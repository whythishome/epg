It is the engine that brings you closer to the vision of yourself, overcoming challenges, fulfilling dreams and achieving goals that you thought were unattainable, like running a race in the middle of the desert. Your purpose drives you from the depths of your being, it becomes your obsession and inspires you to find time where it seemed nonexistent, will where there used to be excuses, and energy in places where there used to be apathy. Your purpose will guide you to become the person you always dreamed of being, lead you to live the authentic life you long for, and lift you to a state of greatness. The Škoda Titan Desert Morocco can be explained in many ways: through its route, its landscapes, its winners... but there is no better way to do it than through its people. Their stories. The Purpose is a documentary that brings together and delves into five of the stories we experienced in the 2024 edition of the race. Stories of passion, overcoming, love and courage. Because it is them: Martí, Jan, Michal, Alejandra, Daniel and Konny who make a mountainbike race much more than that. Let it be a vital experience that changes lives.</desc></programme>

Despite this great symbolism, the objectives and ambitions of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra are first and foremost musical: the political divisions of the Middle East are setting aside the time of the union of these young musical talents which speaks volumes about the power of cultural interaction.

Directed by Barry Gavin, this concert took place at the Berliner Philharmonie in 1992. Mahler was inspired by Jean Paul’s novel Titan, in which an artistically gifted young man, driven by his failure to find his way in society, eventually commits suicide in despair. The genesis of this work was not easy for Mahler: he composed it between 1887 and 1888, at the time when he was conductor of the Leipzig opera. The first version of the work first took the form of a two-part symphonic poem and premiered in Budapest in 1898. However, the work was poorly received by the public and critics, which forced Mahler to revise it. The new version resulted in the wonderful Symphony No. 1 that we know today, an incredible achievement for such a young composer.</desc></programme>

In this composition, the violin does not allow itself a break, continually tells its dark story and gets into a vicious circle of ostinato Passacaglia bass lines again and again falls into beguilingly beautiful singing. Tchaikovsky initially thought his &apos;Symphony of Fate&apos; was a failure and believed himself to be at the end of his creative powers. It was probably the composer&apos;s nature, plagued by self-doubt, that made it almost impossible for him to develop a self-confident attitude to his own creative power. Between this two works, Skride performs Stravinsky&apos;s Elegy for Solo Violin.</desc></programme>

Not Another Black Movie is not only a spoof of a genre often associated with Tyler Perry films, but a satirical look at family dysfunction as well. Written by Jay Davis and Directed by Donte &quot;Diesel&quot; Williams, Not Another Black Movie addresses issues that effect many families whether they be rich or poor, black or white. Although we poke fun at some of the stereotypical roles portrayed in this genre, we hope to shed some light on problems that plague many families while giving you a good laugh.</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

His passion for authenticity and obsession for comfort, pours out every minute you spend here. This place has a charming personality and we went directly to the source.Interview: MARCO BETTIOWhen I came here 10 years ago and started to do some consulting. I started to receive a lot of guests from all around the world..and I was always forced to bring them to fine dining places. I noticed that my clients weren’t really comfortable in the fine dining experience the first day they arrived in Shanghai.That’s what moved me to bring this real Italian dining experience to this area. I would say that we would always try to give a tailormade type of service. Greeting everybody, making them feel comfortable, it’s one of the most important things for us.Actually, “Goodfellas”..is meant to mean “good friends”..and this is the idea. There is no ego, there is no name of the chef, or my name on the door,..nothing but “Goodfellas.” It’s a place to for a good time with your friends, business partners, clients..to have an intimate experience in an enjoyable way.Chef Antonio is a great master, we actually call him “the maestro”,..it’s the italian way to address a very experienced chef. Since day one, Chef has been in charge of everything inside the kitchen...scouting the best ingredients and creating the recipes. Coming from big hotels, he initially wanted the kitchen to be very serious, less smiling, less interactive, etc..I never agreed with this, so we had to find a balance. And it took almost a year until we found that balance,...after he saw the happy customers and atmosphere we knew we were on to something and it because very harmonic. There is never an argument between the kitchen and the staff, and it’s amazing. This is a very big achievement..norma</desc></programme>

Prehistoric natural wonders and ancient Mayan ruins are scattered among world-class resorts slinging more fresh lobster and mezcal than the human body is probably meant to consume. Long known for its yoga retreats and rustic eco-hotels, the off-the-grid Tulum of 15 years ago is still there, but it now exists alongside thrumming nightlife and unparalleled culinary adventures. Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension. With breathtaking beaches, history you can touch, and a unique kind of artistic-inspired luxury, Tulum is whatever you want it to be. Oh, and there are lots of tequila and tacos, too. Do take advantage of that.</desc></programme>

With the cameras rolling, he wears his character as a mask, not wishing to expose his face. He is about 5’3, with a skinny frame, his dyed blonde hair peeking out from behind his mask. “My father always objected to my interest in drawing, but my mother was rather supportive. Some of my most precious memories are of those childhood drawings. I would show them to my mother, deeply excited, and she would look at them and say, ‘Oh, that’s [a] really nice picture’, and then display it on the fridge using a magnet. And I would feel so proud every time she did this. I would think, ‘Wow, I need to draw more, because I want more things to be displayed on the fridge’, and then slowly…. the fridge got filled up. And the old drawings would be removed, and the whole process would be repeated. And this small matter, and that fridge, they influenced me, and allowed me to feel like perhaps I should continue drawing in the future.”On the other hand, Duncan’s father was a strict figure, quite the opposite of his mother. “My father never smiled at me from the day I was born till the day he passed away. He never genuinely smiled at me and was always kind of distant - he’s a very, very strict kind of father - so we never really talked much, and of course after I graduated from high school, I left home.” Like all typical Asian parents, Duncan’s father hammered the notion: ‘do not pursue art because you’ll starve to death’, and that if he became an artist, ‘you’ll only earn money after you’re dead’.During his university years, Duncan majored i</desc></programme>

This huge tree-shaped island was built from sand, rock and sheer determination. What keeps it all in place is this 11-kilometer breakwater crescent, lined with five-star hotels, this protective halo has two openings side that allows the famously clear blue waters to flow with the tide. Seventy-eight thousand residents call Palm Jumeirah home, living in luxury apartment blocks on the trunk and private gated estates on the fronds. Its also the address of some of Dubais most exclusive hotel accommodation from Anantaras overwater villas to Atlantiss underwater suites. Elsewhere at Skyline Defining Atlantis, there’s a world-class water park and a network of aquariums filled with 65000 inhabitants. And for a truly surreal experience, you can even walk among them. Or perhaps you prefer to fly? The latest way to get a birds eye view of this manmade megastructure in a gyrocopter. Similar to helicopters, two-seat aircraft reach heights of fifteen hundred feet. Another way to explore Palm Jumeirah is by sea, and the 78-kilometer shoreline is dotted with idyllic seaside destinations. &quot;Club Vista Mare is tucked away on the eastern trunk, very popular destination for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one ‘star’ attraction of Vista Mare is its pool in the sea,&quot; says Rebecca Rees. And the new Palm Tower will showcase a wraparound infinity pool on the 50th floor, providing unparalleled views of this iconic island.</desc></programme>

There arent many meals that can claim royal lineage dating back almost a thousand years to the ancient emperors of China. Known as Peking Duck, Beijing Duck or Chinese Roast Duck , this dish is a signature staple of the city and you could spend weeks soul searching and taste testing your way through a variety of recipes (yes, even KFC has one).  To save you time, Duck de Chine is one of the annual contenders for the best roast duck in the land and offers an extravagant dining experience. An impressive and inviting décor, complete with vermillion fabrics, dazzling chandeliers, cozy brick walls and large round tables, offers a luxury setting to indulge in the local specialty. Whether you enjoy sugar or spice, a variety of delicious sides accompany the glistening moist meat of this whole duck, prepared over the open flames of 60 year old Jujube wood. Pro tip: dip the crispy skin directly in the raw sugar and enjoy the ride. Smaller dishes, a separate dim sum menu and a full champagne bar are also available so set aside plenty of time to plant yourself in this beautiful dining room and feast away like its 1330.</desc></programme>

Michela Colella, Operations Manager, Divers Down UAE said, &quot;We will go to an average depth of 14 metres.

Some of the most spectacular coral and marine life are located just 5 metres from the surface. At that depth, everything is lit up beautifully and the air lasts much longer than at 10 or 15 metres. The reef has species ranging from stingrays to lobsters, jawfish, parrotfish, broomtail wrasse, and many others.

Taiwan saw a rise in abandoned animals during the 1980’s, during a time of economic growth. Residents who were uninformed of the responsibilities that comes with raising a pet, eventually abandoned said animals on the streets. Today, we have invited Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor, model and humanitarian, to interview the Director of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The setting is at the Zhonghe Animal Shelter, a place that has truly become a haven for stray dogs in recent years.Operating under the government of New Taipei City, Zhonghe Animal Shelter seeks to provide unwanted dogs with the safest and best care they can afford. Upon entering their care, every animal will be given vaccination, a health screening, de-worming, microchip implantation, and are spayed or neutered. Depending on their gender, male dogs will receive a mark on the left ear, while females are marked on the right ear. Once the process is finished, these dogs are ready for adoption.While there are other breeds at the animal shelter, their stay is never long since they get adopted rather swiftly, leaving the shelter with a 90 majority of the Formosan Mountain Dog, or more simply known as, Taiwanese Dog. The characteristics of the Taiwanese dog breed include a triangular face, agile feet that are known for their hopping skill, and a sickle tail. The personality of the Formosan is loyal, intelligent, affectionate and understanding. “These dogs are suited for being hunting or search dogs, so the current feeding rate for these dogs is quite high. We mainly have black ones, but we also have brown and yellow ones,” says the Director.Currently, most, if not all the dogs at the Shelter have been desexed. This ‘zero-kill’ plan started on the 1st of March last year, under the guidance of the mayor of New Taipei City, Zhu Li Luen. Howeve</desc></programme>

There are 32 kilometres of track in the area. More than a dozen possible routes have been mapped out, with four different levels of ability. Kayaking is also on offer on the vast lake next to the Hatta dam. Fitness expert and Youtube star Lilly Sabri @lillysabri says the walking is an ideal complement to a regular routine. “I think that when you’re on a holiday you want to make memories as well… so trying different things,” she says. “So, if you’re someone goes to the gym wherever you normally train and in whatever country that might be, it might be nice to try something different. So, getting outside. You certainly couldn’t do this in London where I’m originally from.

From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer.

Namie’s futuristic robot-inspired venue is as visually stimulating as it is entertaining and interactive. She walks us through her inspiration for what now has become a staple experience for locals and global travellers.Interview: NAMIE OSAWA I opened Robot Restaurant three years ago. Even though I was hesitant to show the first concept to foreigners and so forth, I decided to open the restaurant in Kabukicho with the Japanese Businessman in mind. When thinking about what would be appealing to a businessman, I thought about Robots - which I longed for as a kid,..and Girls in sexy costumes. These were the things that initially came to mind. Our rehearsals begin at 11 o’clock in the morning including Wadaiko, which is a Japanese drum dance. We practice for about an hour and thirty minutes, then we have a brief meeting before the show. Rehearsals can be tough, but whatever we go over, ..it’s amazing and we have fun and I think it’s very good. Still, I think that there is a part where not a lot of the content catches on with the audience. Even after repeated viewings, I would like to think that each show was better than the one before it. But on the name alone, people were intrigued and when it arrived, it was beyond the imagination because I wanted it to be a thoughtful experience. Always keep going forward, it’s what we want out of this show. I want to make sure there’s more to it than just a name.</desc></programme>

Vanessa’s restaurant celebrates delicious dishes and memorable moments. She talks us through her inspiration behind what is one of Taipei’s most warm and authentic French dining experiences.Interview: Vanessa HuangActually our restaurant is unlike others in Taiwan, in that our menu is different everyday. We make adjustments based on our daily findings at the market, and we design our menu around that. For example, if we see really fresh seafood or vegetables or meat, we’ll put that on the menu.I can’t really say that I have one signature dish, and even when our guests keep coming week after week asking for a specific dish, I get bored of making the same thing and will want to move on to something else. What I like is giving our guests something new every time.A very special moment for me is when my parents go to the fields themselves and handpick ingredients for me, like lemongrass, lily flower root, etc, and I’ll use them to make ice cream or appetizers. And the part that makes me most proud and happy is when I get to tell our customers, ‘this was handpicked by my mom!’. But of course, it doesn’t happen often, only sometimes when the chance arises.I went to France at the end of 2002, to attend the cooking school, Ferrandi. At the time I just wanted to have my own little coffee shop, like most young girls. But one day my chef, my mentor at the school, asked me if I wanted to do a stage (internship) at a 3 starred Michelin restaurant, he thought it was a great opportunity for me. I agreed, not even knowing what Michelin was, and that experience would go on to change my life.Being the only female and foreigner student during my stage, I didn’t want to lose to everyone else, and I would push myself to keep up. Although it was daunting and disheartening when I couldn’t understand my teacher, I continued to give it my all, and at the time I felt like maybe I was working harder than othe</desc></programme>

Around the world, aging populations, rising healthcare costs, and pressures on the insurance industry have created opportunities for destinations like Dubai , that have been able to invest rapidly in their healthcare infrastructure and capitalise on the sharp increase in demand for health tourism. Encouraging international institutions Dr Marwan Mohamed Al Mulla, CEO, Health Regulation Sector, Dubai Health Authority said, “Recently a new law has come into effect which encourages and allows international institutions to have their own, 100 percent ownership The Dubai Health Authority has had a medical tourism strategy in place since 2014 with the aim of developing and supporting its healthcare sector and steadily increasing its contribution towards Dubais gross domestic product. Focusing on an inbound patient’s airport-to-airport needs has helped providers capitalise too. Dr Basel Nasrallah, Medical Director, Armada said, “We in our facility, for example, get about 5 percent more patients from abroad. Patients are coming from all around the world. We are receiving patients from Russia, mainly Europe, Italy, Spain, UK, and North America from Africa, from South Asia Why have health checks in Dubai? Interestingly, many of those countries are known for the strength of their own medical tourism offerings, but Dubai is still an attractive option for patients who are looking to combine their treatments with other pursuits.

In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep - took off in one from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring. “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.” Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.” Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc></programme>

When it comes to Taiwan and food, experts and enthusiasts alike know that they go hand-in-hand.  It is no wonder Taipei is overflowing with electricity as new ideas and re-imagined classics are popping up all over town. This magical friction is a big reason Taipei’s food scene is attracting young talent from the world’s best kitchens looking to experiment, innovate, and test their ideas against the discerning palates of the local crowds.  Highlighted by some of the world’s best produce, great transportation, magnificent hiking trails 5 minutes from downtown, a vibrant nightlife, and an openness towards travelers and new faces makes Taipei one of Black Buddha’s favorite cities.</desc></programme>

A report by the United Nations earlier this year claimed animal extinctions are at an unprecedented high. According to the organisation, as many as one million species are under threat. On a visit to the desert, you might expect to find camels or antelope, maybe some hawks. But Dubai’s Al Marmoom animal sanctuary is teeming with biodiversity with hundreds of different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The sanctuary covers 20 percent of the whole area of Dubai. In the beginning, it was a desert populated by native animals, but as the sanctuary expanded to more than 50 oases, it was discovered  these water bodies could control the environmental balance. The sanctuary has even managed to attract the Arabian Oryx. This animal was declared extinct in the wild in 1972, but has now been brought back from the brink by the reserve. Saoud Faisal is a wildlife officer at the Al Marmoom sanctuary. He says in the 80s and 90s the Oryx were overhunted for food. Now the animal is considered part of the regions wildlife. “They are totally protected now and also they are healthy,” he explains. “We have them in large numbers which last year reached more than 500.&quot; From desert oases to indoor tropical environments, recent laws in Dubai mean greater governmental support for animal sanctuaries. Laws were introduced in 2007 to cover animal welfare, but awareness really started to build in 2016. The laws also apply to rare and exotic animals. Some are looked after in animal sanctuaries like Green Planet. Everything about Green Planet was designed specifically to create the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals in the middle of the Dubai desert. The sanctuary houses a wide range of species including many different birds, and mammals such as two-toed sloths. And lizards like green iguanas or basilisks. The latest addition t</desc></programme>

It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials.

The meal that follows is known as Iftar, and you do not have to be Muslim to partake in one. In this edition of Taste, Euronews visited the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Hotel in Dubai, to sample the special Iftar menu produced by the worlds first Emirati chef. After Athan, the call for evening prayer, Muslims who have been fasting all day can finally eat and drink. The fast is broken by first eating dates. This is of great religious significance, chef Musabbeh Al Kaabi explained. &quot;Prophet Mohammed used to do this when he was breaking his fast, so we always break it with the dates then laban (a fermented milk drink) or water,&quot; he said. Chef Musabbeh first served up a traditional dish - king rice. Its name comes from its historically prestigious status as an expensive dish only eaten by royalty or the rich. &quot;Liver is there, beef is there, saffron rice is there. So it’s all luxury things. I have cooked saffron rice, I have fried cauliflower, boiled chickpeas. Now I need to take the flavour of the onions with all these things,&quot; Chef Musabbeh said as he prepared the dish. &quot;I will put the rice in now. I’ll put some spices in as well. So now, I’m going to put it on a plate, and I’m going to garnish it&quot; But, before eating, everyone said Bismillā, which means in the name of Allah. Chef Musabbeh then prepared his second dish the famous Emirati ouzi with oriental rice, a lamb dish with cinnamon and cardamom. You can make the dish yourself by following the recipe below: Chef Musabbehs Ouzi and Oriental Rice Recipe Ingredients: 1100g lamb shank 500g of basmati rice 100g of minced lamb 2 bay leaves 3 cinnamon sticks 10g of garlic - freshly chopped 120g of onion - freshly chopped 100g of tomato - freshly chopped 20g of ghee butter Salt and pepper 6.5ml of water 10g of tamarind powder 40g of Emirati spices 30g of tomato paste 40g of coriander - freshly chopped Instructions: 1.

The mood is steady, confident, and proud.  With walls that never end, ducks that bear golden skin, and Forbidden Cities out in the open, Beijing has a storybook magic that can only be found in a megacity overflowing with such rich history and tradition. The landmarks and landscapes are dominant forces, followed by the new developments mounted by modernization. Knowing where to look will be the key to unlocking the cities best adventures and experiences. Don’t be afraid to explore the many interesting nooks and crannies of Beijing’s streets and alleys, as there are many. From the bucket list worthy monuments, to the waves of new restaurants, shops, and cultural encounters available, be sure not to rush. Beijing is a hotbed of commerce and entrepreneurship, and inspires the country’s top artists, students, writers, film-makers, musicians, and creatives to converge within its frontiers.

Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash.

This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: &quot;The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below 80 percent in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals.&quot; Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: &quot;It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve.&quot; iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc></programme>

La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club, Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free.

This sought-after holiday destination encompasses the coastal neighbourhood of Jumeirah Beach Residence, known locally as JBR, home to retail and entertainment developments The Walk and The Beach, which multiple the attractions for fun-seekers. Iconic five-star hotels hug the shoreline, their vast marble lobbies leading to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunches and postcard-perfect beaches. Le Méridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is one of the longest-standing hotels in Dubai Marina with 500 metres of private Arabian Gulf coastline providing a playground for water sports enthusiasts. Local expats regularly fill the resort’s Barasti bar, restaurant and beach club. A Dubai institution in its second decade, this well-liked venue has grown into a sprawling sports and beach bar with open-air screenings and food stalls, and the only free-entry beach club in town. Despite progression, Barasti retains its original theme, defined by palm fronds typically found in the traditional barasti shelters favoured by the early Bedouins. Other Dubai Marina beach clubs that draw crowds include Drift to Zero Gravity . Drift is dizzyingly beautiful; its pool deck, a catwalk for the latest swimwear fashions.

For just one dirham, abra rides provide boatloads of nostalgia while travelling between the souks and museums of Deira and Bur Dubai. These heritage hubs recall the Bedouins’ humble and ancient past built on pearls, and then shaped by a free trade boom that brought new settlers to the creek in the early 1900’s. Echoing that era, today’s expats – some descendants of those early traders – share authentic flavours from their homelands in a culinary kaleidoscope that compliments Emirati fare. Popular food tours Food tours are a popular way to explore Dubai Creek. Arva Ahmed is the founder of Frying Pan Adventures. She describes one of the restaurants that features on the tours itinerary. &quot;One of the restaurants we stop on our tour is called Sultan Dubai Falafel,&quot; she says. &quot;And the thing that they are known for is stuffed falafels. They stuff them with chilli, onion and sumac. These falafels are the most juiciest most filled with herbs and fragrant falafels that you’re going to find in the city.&quot; Deira’s Waterfront market is piled high with technicolour fruit and vegetables and stacks of shellfish with legs choreographed in chorus-line unison. Here you can buy the catch of the day and have it cooked in many different ways for old-school Creekside dining. Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary Until recently, the creek ended at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary. Here nature lovers can spot flamingos that migrate to the Sanctuary, a wetland extension of the creek spread over 6.2 sq.km. It features a variety of mangroves and lagoons perfect for migrating birds - the sanctuary is home to over 180 species of birds. Following its expansion as Dubai Canal, the creek curves past book-shaped Mohammed Bin Rashid Library, high-rise Business Bay and beach-hugging Jumeirah before it’s reunited with its source - the glittering Arabian Gulf.</desc></programme>

Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience. We like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Milk Tea Cake, Sriracha Street Corn, and Lemongrass Pork Chop.

Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc></programme>

Looking at her million-watt smile now, little would one have guessed that Liya also went through a dark period in her life. When she won the ELLE Model Look competition back in 2005, at the very height of her career, she bid farewell to the life of glitz and glamour and moved to Shanghai to live a quiet life of marital bliss with her then-newly-wed husband, Lin Yongchao. Just two years into the marriage, the once happy couple divorced and went their separate ways. The period that followed was a downward spiral that Liya finds hard to look back upon even now. Yet, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she found a new burning passion that reawakened her zest for life - her love of fitness and exercise.Today, Liya has taken time out of her day to tell us her story and recent endeavors. With smooth, sun-kissed skin and minimal make up, Liya flashes us her pearly-whites that remind us of the famous Disney character, Pocahontas. Growing up, becoming a model never crossed Liya’s mind. She perceived her tanned skin and naturally curly hair as against the norm of what was considered aesthetically beautiful, and was naturally surprised when she was approached by a stylist while strolling in Ximending, one of Taipei’s popular shopping districts. The stylist asked her to go in for a casting at Eelin, the model management company in which she is currently still signed to today. As it was Summer break and she had little to do, Liya decided to go to the casting with little expectations, and thus unwittingly began her fifteen-year-long career.It wasn’t all smooth sailing from there, especially the first couple of years into the modelling business. Liya found herself trying to be someone else, fitting into the mold of the successful models before her, afraid to stand out and be herself. Her skin tone, her h</desc></programme>

But Ocean Active Fly has re-imagined this scene - offering urban fly fishing right in the middle of Dubai. This is the first fly fishing operation in the Middle East. The founder, Nick Bowles, explained to Euronews why fishing there are fishing opportunities in Dubai: &quot;Dubai’s built the biggest man-made reefs with the palm islands and that, so it’s created a huge habitat.&quot; Artificial reefs can lead to a quick increase in the local fish population. They draw plankton which smaller fish can prey on which then attracts bigger fish suitable for fly fishing. One species drawn to the artificial reefs in Dubai is the queenfish. They can grow to be over a metre long and up to 15 kilograms, although most are about half that weight. This kind of fish is particularly good for fly fishing because of its visual takes and the fact it swims in schools. Fly fishing differs from more conventional spin fishing. Instead of having a heavy lure at the end of the fishing line, fly fishers have a fly which is lighter and less likely to scare away game. The fly stays on the surface of the water where fish will be attracted to it, thinking it is prey. With ocean fly fishing youre constantly on the move to find the next school of fish &quot;So you literally run - shoot, run - shoot.&quot; But the unique part of fly fishing in Dubai is the proximity to its skyline. Fly fishing is done close to the shore so anglers are surrounded by the citys landmarks.: the Burj Khalifa, the Burj Al Arab, Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina.</desc></programme>

Camel races Old meets new can be seen at Dubais Camel Racing Club where these ships of the desert sprint across the perimeter of the famed Al Mamoom racetrack. Attracting both camel owners and punters alike, spectators can sit in their cars and drive alongside the camels as they hurtle towards the finish line, guided by a remote control jockey. Organisers say the event is a draw for tourists for a number of reasons. “When tourists come to the camel racing venues, they see something new. They see how people treat the camels and how the camels compete with each other. They also see how Emirati society promotes camels, says the clubs CEO and General Amanager Ali Saeed Bin Saroud. Camel racing was promoted by the former UAE president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as a way of bringing camels and back into mainstream Dubai culture. The Dubai Royal Family also actively support camel racing as a way of preserving the traditional Bedouin culture. Desert culture The Al Marmoom Heritage Festival is Dubai’s annual celebration of the traditional Arabian desert culture and vital role which it plays in the cultural identity of its people. Traditional markets, music and dancing are another way in which the Bedouin culture is kept alive and enjoyed by Dubai locals and tourists alike. Arabic hospitality German expat Ursula Musch moved to Dubai around 20 years ago after first visiting in 1993. She now breeds camels and encourages tourists to experience the Bedouin customs for themselves, as they, like her, may just find their passion in life.

In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the worlds largest vegan restaurant (‘Veganity’) has just opened its doors. Veganity’s founder Sky Sommer’s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice. With over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer’s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt. “Its actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.” Below weve provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home.

But, in fact, its history goes back more than 5,000 years. Archaeologists have unearthed a series of exciting and mysterious discoveries across the Emirate. These include the Jumeirah Archaeological site, which dates back to the Abbasid Period in the 10th century AD, to the Saruq Al Hadid site – a centre for human inhabitants and trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600-2000 BCE) to the Iron Age. When the Jumeirah Archaeological site was discovered, experts noticed that the walls of the buildings there were plastered. Dr Mansour Boraik, an archaeology specialist from Dubai, said: &quot;It was plastered inside and outside with white plaster. When they tried to picture the city during the Abbasid Period, and they imagined that it would look like a white city from the shores of the Gulf.&quot; The site shows Dubai during the Abbasid period which is around the 10th century AD. The geographical location of the site is important. It sits on the shoreline of Dubai but also on the major trade route between Mesopotamia, India and Oman. It also sits in-between the Arabic and Indian peninsular. The 80,000 square metre site sits in the shadow of the Burj Khalifa and the imposing Dubai skyline, emphasising the comparison between old and new worlds. The circular and semi-circular tower supports reflect the prosperity of the inhabitants of the time who will have been a mixture of locals and passing tradesmen. A variety of silver coins, pottery, copper, glass and stone artefacts have been excavated. Its one of the largest and most important Islamic sites ever discovered in the Gulf. It is also home to the oldest Mosque discovered in the UAE. Saruq al Hadid Saruq al Hadid is regarded as the jewel in the crown of archaeological discoveries In Dubai.

About the size of 60 rugby fields, it has been created to give visitors some green space and a better understanding of Islamic beliefs. Inside the park’s orchards and Glass House, visitors can discover a variety of healthy and medicinal flora featured in the Holy Quran, from pomegranates and olives, to figs and garlic. Another attraction at Quranic Park is the Cave of Miracles, where seven miracles recounted in the Holy Quran play out on the walls. &quot;The cave was amazing,&quot; says Usman, who is visiting from the UK. &quot;We learnt a lot about the miracles growing up, it just gave another understanding to it. And it was great to visualise it, not just hear about it.&quot; &quot;This is an open example that the Quran is not just to read in order to get reward but it is something that can be in practical life,&quot; says Anwar, a visitor from the US. &quot;This place is beautiful and a very interesting experience for children. Here, they can actually experience things from the Quran,&quot; says Miteab, who lives in Saudi Arabia.  Al Shindagha Perfume House From aromatic flora to the UAE’s first museum dedicated to fragrance. The Al Shindagha museum is home to the  Perfume House . Part of a complex created to gather, preserve and share Emirati heritage, Perfume House charts the history and role of fragrance in the region. Rashed Almuhairi is Perfume House’s Chief Cultural Guide.  “It’s special and important not only for the guests who are coming, he tells Euronews. &quot;It’s for our own generations also. A lot of our youth, they didn’t live in many things like perfuming or pearl diving, so it’s important that they know about our past life. Dubai has a very rich history which needs to be told.” One of the more unusual exhibits on display is a 28 kilogramme piece of oud.

Nothing can prepare visitors for the true scale of record-breaking Burj Khalifa . At twice the height of the Empire State Building and almost three times the size of the Eiffel Tower, it soars 828 metres into the sky. Inside, there are 160 floors occupied by designer Giorgio Armani’s first-ever hotel , award-winning restaurants, luxury apartments and offices – and observation decks at levels 124, 125 and 148. Colourful wings, painted on observation deck windows, are designed for guests to pose between them. Part of the Global Angel Wings Project by Colette Miller, before appearing in Dubai, they were seen in Australia, China, Cuba, Europe, Kenya, Japan and the United States. The wings hint that humans can be angels of the earth and serve as a reminder to do good. Next door, The Dubai Mall houses more of Downtown Dubai’s supersized attractions. Visitors can cage-dive with sharks at the vast Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo and Dubai Mall’s indoor ice rink is an ample fit for professional figure skaters at 60 metres long; it can also snow here at the flick of a switch. While some attractions defy reality, others escape it altogether. Dubbed ‘The Centre of Now’, Downtown Dubai can take visitors to the future at the world’s largest VR Park in The Dubai Mall, a hive of virtual and augmented realities. Dubai in 2050 is the setting of indoor park’s augmented reality rollercoaster, made all the more exhilarating with headsets that place passengers in the cockpit of a computer-generated helicopter. As the virtual helicopter orbits out of the control, the very real, very fast rollercoaster cars plummet through loops and spin on their axes. Bustling with entertainment, Downtown Dubai’s high-octane epicentre is looped by the laidback, café-lined Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Boulevard – a starting point for a public art trail. Downtown Dubai is an urban canvas of sculptures</desc></programme>

Home to Alserkal Avenue – actually a block of streets lined with some of the best art galleries in Dubai – Al Quoz is full of surprises. There’s more than world-class art hidden behind Al Quozs vast landscape of warehouses; where theres art, theres life, after all – and life here is vibrant. Just about every enterprise in Al Quoz comes with an exciting twist; for example, Al Quoz restaurant and speciality coffee bar Café Rider  doubles as a custom motorbike store. Mirzam , meanwhile, is an artisan chocolate factory thats also a café, located in the neighbourhood’s central art hub,  Alserkal Avenue . Alserkal Avenue cafes are defined by their fair-trade principles and creative concoctions that echo the area’s artistic character. From golden turmeric lattes to immune-boosting vegan matcha bowls, menus are bursting with goodness. Things to do in Alserkal Avenue and neighbouring complex, The Courtyard, include inspiring workshops; there are several to choose between. At  Oo La Lab , a fragrance mixology studio in Alserkal Avenue, you can learn how to create your own signature cologne. Or, just across the road, you can join an art class in Dubai’s popular community art space  thejamjar . Going strong for 15 years, thejamjar is a regular host of Alserkal Avenue events and art lessons, teaches budding artists of all ages several disciplines, from painting with oils to acrylic techniques. Tilika D’Souza, an art instructor at thejamjar, says the wellbeing of the participants is also important to the foundation: &quot;We have a workshop called  Intuitive Creativity  that combines meditation and art; we use all kinds of different art materials and we do a little meditation to begin with, so everybody is really relaxed during and after the class.&quot; For those who prefer to shop, tempting retail options include independent boutiques, such as Chi-Ka , a</desc></programme>

Its a cafe attached to an actual Tteok museum (koreans take their rice cakes seriously) inside the old, traditional Insadong neighborhood. Nothing new or trendy but its actually one of those places that you may find yourself wandering back into after your initial bad attitude. The first floor houses the Tteok Cafe where one can essentially purchase and eat every variety of Tteok known to mankind pretty much. The textures and fillings are as varied as the many colors that are on display and its easy to mindlessly go into a tteok-frenzy but it pays to be selective because theres only so much glutinous rice hunks one can eat in one sitting and tteok is known to go stale quickly.When youve had your fill of colorful starch, head up to the 2nd floor where you can find the museum part of the experience and learn about the thousands of years of tteok history. And if youre wanting a little more action after, head on over to the traditional Korean Liquor Museum which is in the same building.In total, this place really is a hub for Koreas days of yore, including spreads on North Korean cuisine and what emperors have been served . Just make sure you come brave enough to try the dried manta ray.</desc></programme>

It has the most amazing sunrises which I delighted in each day from my private balcony. The hotel is located directly on the beach which makes it very difficult to leave. I visit the charming beachside town of Lauderdale by the Sea, a 10 minute drive from my hotel. I also take a tour at Butterfly World, the first and largest butterfly house in the United States. It is home over 80 species of butterflies, hummingbird and lorikeet aviaries, and outdoor gardens. This place is truly magical for people of all ages. Pompano Beach is the quintessential beach town. You can truly relax and enjoy the beach at your own pace while indulging as much or as little as you’d like.</desc></programme>

The nature that surrounds and pushes through the city, gives Hong Kong it’s true indescribable magic. Denizens know where to find the hiking trails, the views, and escape routes to the open sea.

His passion for authenticity and obsession for comfort, pours out every minute you spend here. This place has a charming personality and we went directly to the source.Interview: MARCO BETTIOWhen I came here 10 years ago and started to do some consulting. I started to receive a lot of guests from all around the world..and I was always forced to bring them to fine dining places. I noticed that my clients weren’t really comfortable in the fine dining experience the first day they arrived in Shanghai.That’s what moved me to bring this real Italian dining experience to this area. I would say that we would always try to give a tailormade type of service. Greeting everybody, making them feel comfortable, it’s one of the most important things for us.Actually, “Goodfellas”..is meant to mean “good friends”..and this is the idea. There is no ego, there is no name of the chef, or my name on the door,..nothing but “Goodfellas.” It’s a place to for a good time with your friends, business partners, clients..to have an intimate experience in an enjoyable way.Chef Antonio is a great master, we actually call him “the maestro”,..it’s the italian way to address a very experienced chef. Since day one, Chef has been in charge of everything inside the kitchen...scouting the best ingredients and creating the recipes. Coming from big hotels, he initially wanted the kitchen to be very serious, less smiling, less interactive, etc..I never agreed with this, so we had to find a balance. And it took almost a year until we found that balance,...after he saw the happy customers and atmosphere we knew we were on to something and it because very harmonic. There is never an argument between the kitchen and the staff, and it’s amazing. This is a very big achievement..norma</desc></programme>

Long known for its yoga retreats and rustic eco-hotels, the off-the-grid Tulum of 15 years ago is still there, but it now exists alongside thrumming nightlife and unparalleled culinary adventures. Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension. With breathtaking beaches, history you can touch, and a unique kind of artistic-inspired luxury, Tulum is whatever you want it to be. Oh, and there are lots of tequila and tacos, too. Do take advantage of that.</desc></programme>

With a fanbase of 20 million and growing, Duncan has been approached by various renowned companies, such as Line, Asus, and TVBS for creative collaborations. He uses a caricature of himself as the main protagonist in his comics, which are centered around the hilarious going-ons of his daily life. With the cameras rolling, he wears his character as a mask, not wishing to expose his face. He is about 5’3, with a skinny frame, his dyed blonde hair peeking out from behind his mask. “My father always objected to my interest in drawing, but my mother was rather supportive. Some of my most precious memories are of those childhood drawings. I would show them to my mother, deeply excited, and she would look at them and say, ‘Oh, that’s [a] really nice picture’, and then display it on the fridge using a magnet. And I would feel so proud every time she did this. I would think, ‘Wow, I need to draw more, because I want more things to be displayed on the fridge’, and then slowly…. the fridge got filled up. And the old drawings would be removed, and the whole process would be repeated. And this small matter, and that fridge, they influenced me, and allowed me to feel like perhaps I should continue drawing in the future.”On the other hand, Duncan’s father was a strict figure, quite the opposite of his mother. “My father never smiled at me from the day I was born till the day he passed away. He never genuinely smiled at me and was always kind of distant - he’s a very, very strict kind of father - so we never really talked much, and of course after I graduated from high school, I left home.” Like all typical Asian parents, Duncan’s father hammered the notion: ‘do not pursue art because you’ll starve to death’, and that if he became an artist, ‘you’ll only earn money after you’re dead’.During his university years, Duncan majored i</desc></programme>

This huge tree-shaped island was built from sand, rock and sheer determination. What keeps it all in place is this 11-kilometer breakwater crescent, lined with five-star hotels, this protective halo has two openings side that allows the famously clear blue waters to flow with the tide. Seventy-eight thousand residents call Palm Jumeirah home, living in luxury apartment blocks on the trunk and private gated estates on the fronds. Its also the address of some of Dubais most exclusive hotel accommodation from Anantaras overwater villas to Atlantiss underwater suites. Elsewhere at Skyline Defining Atlantis, there’s a world-class water park and a network of aquariums filled with 65000 inhabitants. And for a truly surreal experience, you can even walk among them. Or perhaps you prefer to fly? The latest way to get a birds eye view of this manmade megastructure in a gyrocopter. Similar to helicopters, two-seat aircraft reach heights of fifteen hundred feet. Another way to explore Palm Jumeirah is by sea, and the 78-kilometer shoreline is dotted with idyllic seaside destinations. &quot;Club Vista Mare is tucked away on the eastern trunk, very popular destination for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one ‘star’ attraction of Vista Mare is its pool in the sea,&quot; says Rebecca Rees. And the new Palm Tower will showcase a wraparound infinity pool on the 50th floor, providing unparalleled views of this iconic island.</desc></programme>

There arent many meals that can claim royal lineage dating back almost a thousand years to the ancient emperors of China. Known as Peking Duck, Beijing Duck or Chinese Roast Duck , this dish is a signature staple of the city and you could spend weeks soul searching and taste testing your way through a variety of recipes (yes, even KFC has one).  To save you time, Duck de Chine is one of the annual contenders for the best roast duck in the land and offers an extravagant dining experience. An impressive and inviting décor, complete with vermillion fabrics, dazzling chandeliers, cozy brick walls and large round tables, offers a luxury setting to indulge in the local specialty. Whether you enjoy sugar or spice, a variety of delicious sides accompany the glistening moist meat of this whole duck, prepared over the open flames of 60 year old Jujube wood. Pro tip: dip the crispy skin directly in the raw sugar and enjoy the ride. Smaller dishes, a separate dim sum menu and a full champagne bar are also available so set aside plenty of time to plant yourself in this beautiful dining room and feast away like its 1330.</desc></programme>

Michela Colella, Operations Manager, Divers Down UAE said, &quot;We will go to an average depth of 14 metres. We’ll look for trumpet fish, triggerfish, clownfish, pufferfish, boxfish.&quot; Even with the basic training completed, diving with an instructor helps you feel safer, develop the right habits, and take in all the best spots on the dive site. Some of the most spectacular coral and marine life are located just 5 metres from the surface. At that depth, everything is lit up beautifully and the air lasts much longer than at 10 or 15 metres. The reef has species ranging from stingrays to lobsters, jawfish, parrotfish, broomtail wrasse, and many others. For more experienced divers there are dozens of shipwrecks and artificial reefs to explore each with unique histories and coral formations.

Taiwan saw a rise in abandoned animals during the 1980’s, during a time of economic growth. Residents who were uninformed of the responsibilities that comes with raising a pet, eventually abandoned said animals on the streets. Today, we have invited Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor, model and humanitarian, to interview the Director of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The setting is at the Zhonghe Animal Shelter, a place that has truly become a haven for stray dogs in recent years.Operating under the government of New Taipei City, Zhonghe Animal Shelter seeks to provide unwanted dogs with the safest and best care they can afford. Upon entering their care, every animal will be given vaccination, a health screening, de-worming, microchip implantation, and are spayed or neutered. Depending on their gender, male dogs will receive a mark on the left ear, while females are marked on the right ear. Once the process is finished, these dogs are ready for adoption.While there are other breeds at the animal shelter, their stay is never long since they get adopted rather swiftly, leaving the shelter with a 90 majority of the Formosan Mountain Dog, or more simply known as, Taiwanese Dog. The characteristics of the Taiwanese dog breed include a triangular face, agile feet that are known for their hopping skill, and a sickle tail. The personality of the Formosan is loyal, intelligent, affectionate and understanding. “These dogs are suited for being hunting or search dogs, so the current feeding rate for these dogs is quite high. We mainly have black ones, but we also have brown and yellow ones,” says the Director.Currently, most, if not all the dogs at the Shelter have been desexed. This ‘zero-kill’ plan started on the 1st of March last year, under the guidance of the mayor of New Taipei City, Zhu Li Luen. Howeve</desc></programme>

And this centuries’ old exclave of Dubai also caters for today’s health conscious traveller. High up in the Hajar mountains you can soak up the history while doing a spot of hiking. There are 32 kilometres of track in the area. More than a dozen possible routes have been mapped out, with four different levels of ability. Kayaking is also on offer on the vast lake next to the Hatta dam. Fitness expert and Youtube star Lilly Sabri @lillysabri says the walking is an ideal complement to a regular routine. “I think that when you’re on a holiday you want to make memories as well… so trying different things,” she says. “So, if you’re someone goes to the gym wherever you normally train and in whatever country that might be, it might be nice to try something different. So, getting outside. You certainly couldn’t do this in London where I’m originally from.

From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer.

While tall gleaming skyscrapers haven’t taken over the landscape like much of Tokyo, there’s a good balance of historical and contemporary architecture to keep things interesting.Walk around and you’ll find neighborhood pockets that focusing on one thing: an entire street of used bookstores, another with stores and stores hawking vintage and new guitars; a three-story mecca for old-school arcade games; an entire block for ski and snowboarding gear. You can find Michelin-starred restaurants, gyoza specialists, internationally known ramen shops, and even great burger joints around the corner from each other. With friendly and fiercely proud locals who want to share the area’s history, from origami to the Kanda Myojin Shrine, this is a quieter part of Tokyo just waiting to be discovered.</desc></programme>

Namie’s futuristic robot-inspired venue is as visually stimulating as it is entertaining and interactive. She walks us through her inspiration for what now has become a staple experience for locals and global travellers.Interview: NAMIE OSAWA I opened Robot Restaurant three years ago. Even though I was hesitant to show the first concept to foreigners and so forth, I decided to open the restaurant in Kabukicho with the Japanese Businessman in mind. When thinking about what would be appealing to a businessman, I thought about Robots - which I longed for as a kid,..and Girls in sexy costumes. These were the things that initially came to mind. Our rehearsals begin at 11 o’clock in the morning including Wadaiko, which is a Japanese drum dance. We practice for about an hour and thirty minutes, then we have a brief meeting before the show. Rehearsals can be tough, but whatever we go over, ..it’s amazing and we have fun and I think it’s very good. Still, I think that there is a part where not a lot of the content catches on with the audience. Even after repeated viewings, I would like to think that each show was better than the one before it. But on the name alone, people were intrigued and when it arrived, it was beyond the imagination because I wanted it to be a thoughtful experience. Always keep going forward, it’s what we want out of this show. I want to make sure there’s more to it than just a name.</desc></programme>

Vanessa’s restaurant celebrates delicious dishes and memorable moments. She talks us through her inspiration behind what is one of Taipei’s most warm and authentic French dining experiences.Interview: Vanessa HuangActually our restaurant is unlike others in Taiwan, in that our menu is different everyday. We make adjustments based on our daily findings at the market, and we design our menu around that. For example, if we see really fresh seafood or vegetables or meat, we’ll put that on the menu.I can’t really say that I have one signature dish, and even when our guests keep coming week after week asking for a specific dish, I get bored of making the same thing and will want to move on to something else. What I like is giving our guests something new every time.A very special moment for me is when my parents go to the fields themselves and handpick ingredients for me, like lemongrass, lily flower root, etc, and I’ll use them to make ice cream or appetizers. And the part that makes me most proud and happy is when I get to tell our customers, ‘this was handpicked by my mom!’. But of course, it doesn’t happen often, only sometimes when the chance arises.I went to France at the end of 2002, to attend the cooking school, Ferrandi. At the time I just wanted to have my own little coffee shop, like most young girls. But one day my chef, my mentor at the school, asked me if I wanted to do a stage (internship) at a 3 starred Michelin restaurant, he thought it was a great opportunity for me. I agreed, not even knowing what Michelin was, and that experience would go on to change my life.Being the only female and foreigner student during my stage, I didn’t want to lose to everyone else, and I would push myself to keep up. Although it was daunting and disheartening when I couldn’t understand my teacher, I continued to give it my all, and at the time I felt like maybe I was working harder than othe</desc></programme>

Around the world, aging populations, rising healthcare costs, and pressures on the insurance industry have created opportunities for destinations like Dubai , that have been able to invest rapidly in their healthcare infrastructure and capitalise on the sharp increase in demand for health tourism. Encouraging international institutions Dr Marwan Mohamed Al Mulla, CEO, Health Regulation Sector, Dubai Health Authority said, “Recently a new law has come into effect which encourages and allows international institutions to have their own, 100 percent ownership The Dubai Health Authority has had a medical tourism strategy in place since 2014 with the aim of developing and supporting its healthcare sector and steadily increasing its contribution towards Dubais gross domestic product. Focusing on an inbound patient’s airport-to-airport needs has helped providers capitalise too. Dr Basel Nasrallah, Medical Director, Armada said, “We in our facility, for example, get about 5 percent more patients from abroad. Patients are coming from all around the world. We are receiving patients from Russia, mainly Europe, Italy, Spain, UK, and North America from Africa, from South Asia Why have health checks in Dubai? Interestingly, many of those countries are known for the strength of their own medical tourism offerings, but Dubai is still an attractive option for patients who are looking to combine their treatments with other pursuits.

In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep - took off in one from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring. “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.” Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.” Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc></programme>

When it comes to Taiwan and food, experts and enthusiasts alike know that they go hand-in-hand.  It is no wonder Taipei is overflowing with electricity as new ideas and re-imagined classics are popping up all over town. This magical friction is a big reason Taipei’s food scene is attracting young talent from the world’s best kitchens looking to experiment, innovate, and test their ideas against the discerning palates of the local crowds.  Highlighted by some of the world’s best produce, great transportation, magnificent hiking trails 5 minutes from downtown, a vibrant nightlife, and an openness towards travelers and new faces makes Taipei one of Black Buddha’s favorite cities.</desc></programme>

A report by the United Nations earlier this year claimed animal extinctions are at an unprecedented high. According to the organisation, as many as one million species are under threat. On a visit to the desert, you might expect to find camels or antelope, maybe some hawks. But Dubai’s Al Marmoom animal sanctuary is teeming with biodiversity with hundreds of different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The sanctuary covers 20 percent of the whole area of Dubai. In the beginning, it was a desert populated by native animals, but as the sanctuary expanded to more than 50 oases, it was discovered  these water bodies could control the environmental balance. The sanctuary has even managed to attract the Arabian Oryx. This animal was declared extinct in the wild in 1972, but has now been brought back from the brink by the reserve. Saoud Faisal is a wildlife officer at the Al Marmoom sanctuary. He says in the 80s and 90s the Oryx were overhunted for food. Now the animal is considered part of the regions wildlife. “They are totally protected now and also they are healthy,” he explains. “We have them in large numbers which last year reached more than 500.&quot; From desert oases to indoor tropical environments, recent laws in Dubai mean greater governmental support for animal sanctuaries. Laws were introduced in 2007 to cover animal welfare, but awareness really started to build in 2016. The laws also apply to rare and exotic animals. Some are looked after in animal sanctuaries like Green Planet. Everything about Green Planet was designed specifically to create the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals in the middle of the Dubai desert. The sanctuary houses a wide range of species including many different birds, and mammals such as two-toed sloths. And lizards like green iguanas or basilisks. The latest addition t</desc></programme>

It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials. The eco packaging company Avani is one firm offering plastic-free alternatives, including a bag made from cassava, a cheap and common root vegetable. The material is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea. Peter Avram, managing director of Avani Middle East, said: “Until a c</desc></programme>

The meal that follows is known as Iftar, and you do not have to be Muslim to partake in one. In this edition of Taste, Euronews visited the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Hotel in Dubai, to sample the special Iftar menu produced by the worlds first Emirati chef. After Athan, the call for evening prayer, Muslims who have been fasting all day can finally eat and drink. The fast is broken by first eating dates. This is of great religious significance, chef Musabbeh Al Kaabi explained. &quot;Prophet Mohammed used to do this when he was breaking his fast, so we always break it with the dates then laban (a fermented milk drink) or water,&quot; he said. Chef Musabbeh first served up a traditional dish - king rice. Its name comes from its historically prestigious status as an expensive dish only eaten by royalty or the rich. &quot;Liver is there, beef is there, saffron rice is there. So it’s all luxury things. I have cooked saffron rice, I have fried cauliflower, boiled chickpeas. Now I need to take the flavour of the onions with all these things,&quot; Chef Musabbeh said as he prepared the dish. &quot;I will put the rice in now. I’ll put some spices in as well. So now, I’m going to put it on a plate, and I’m going to garnish it&quot; But, before eating, everyone said Bismillā, which means in the name of Allah. Chef Musabbeh then prepared his second dish the famous Emirati ouzi with oriental rice, a lamb dish with cinnamon and cardamom. You can make the dish yourself by following the recipe below: Chef Musabbehs Ouzi and Oriental Rice Recipe Ingredients: 1100g lamb shank 500g of basmati rice 100g of minced lamb 2 bay leaves 3 cinnamon sticks 10g of garlic - freshly chopped 120g of onion - freshly chopped 100g of tomato - freshly chopped 20g of ghee butter Salt and pepper 6.5ml of water 10g of tamarind powder 40g of Emirati spices 30g of tomato paste 40g of coriander - freshly chopped Instructions: 1.

Don’t be afraid to explore the many interesting nooks and crannies of Beijing’s streets and alleys, as there are many. From the bucket list worthy monuments, to the waves of new restaurants, shops, and cultural encounters available, be sure not to rush.

Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash.

This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: &quot;The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below 80 percent in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals.&quot; Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: &quot;It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve.&quot; iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc></programme>

La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club, Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free.

This sought-after holiday destination encompasses the coastal neighbourhood of Jumeirah Beach Residence, known locally as JBR, home to retail and entertainment developments The Walk and The Beach, which multiple the attractions for fun-seekers. Iconic five-star hotels hug the shoreline, their vast marble lobbies leading to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunches and postcard-perfect beaches. Le Méridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is one of the longest-standing hotels in Dubai Marina with 500 metres of private Arabian Gulf coastline providing a playground for water sports enthusiasts. Local expats regularly fill the resort’s Barasti bar, restaurant and beach club. A Dubai institution in its second decade, this well-liked venue has grown into a sprawling sports and beach bar with open-air screenings and food stalls, and the only free-entry beach club in town. Despite progression, Barasti retains its original theme, defined by palm fronds typically found in the traditional barasti shelters favoured by the early Bedouins. Other Dubai Marina beach clubs that draw crowds include Drift to Zero Gravity . Drift is dizzyingly beautiful; its pool deck, a catwalk for the latest swimwear fashions.

For just one dirham, abra rides provide boatloads of nostalgia while travelling between the souks and museums of Deira and Bur Dubai. These heritage hubs recall the Bedouins’ humble and ancient past built on pearls, and then shaped by a free trade boom that brought new settlers to the creek in the early 1900’s. Echoing that era, today’s expats – some descendants of those early traders – share authentic flavours from their homelands in a culinary kaleidoscope that compliments Emirati fare. Popular food tours Food tours are a popular way to explore Dubai Creek. Arva Ahmed is the founder of Frying Pan Adventures.

Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary Until recently, the creek ended at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary. Here nature lovers can spot flamingos that migrate to the Sanctuary, a wetland extension of the creek spread over 6.2 sq.km. It features a variety of mangroves and lagoons perfect for migrating birds - the sanctuary is home to over 180 species of birds.

Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience. We like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Milk Tea Cake, Sriracha Street Corn, and Lemongrass Pork Chop. Although it will be a longer wait, do yourself a favor and go for dinner for the best experience.</desc></programme>

Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc></programme>

Looking at her million-watt smile now, little would one have guessed that Liya also went through a dark period in her life. When she won the ELLE Model Look competition back in 2005, at the very height of her career, she bid farewell to the life of glitz and glamour and moved to Shanghai to live a quiet life of marital bliss with her then-newly-wed husband, Lin Yongchao. Just two years into the marriage, the once happy couple divorced and went their separate ways. The period that followed was a downward spiral that Liya finds hard to look back upon even now. Yet, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she found a new burning passion that reawakened her zest for life - her love of fitness and exercise.Today, Liya has taken time out of her day to tell us her story and recent endeavors. With smooth, sun-kissed skin and minimal make up, Liya flashes us her pearly-whites that remind us of the famous Disney character, Pocahontas. Growing up, becoming a model never crossed Liya’s mind. She perceived her tanned skin and naturally curly hair as against the norm of what was considered aesthetically beautiful, and was naturally surprised when she was approached by a stylist while strolling in Ximending, one of Taipei’s popular shopping districts. The stylist asked her to go in for a casting at Eelin, the model management company in which she is currently still signed to today. As it was Summer break and she had little to do, Liya decided to go to the casting with little expectations, and thus unwittingly began her fifteen-year-long career.It wasn’t all smooth sailing from there, especially the first couple of years into the modelling business. Liya found herself trying to be someone else, fitting into the mold of the successful models before her, afraid to stand out and be herself. Her skin tone, her h</desc></programme>

But Ocean Active Fly has re-imagined this scene - offering urban fly fishing right in the middle of Dubai. This is the first fly fishing operation in the Middle East. The founder, Nick Bowles, explained to Euronews why fishing there are fishing opportunities in Dubai: &quot;Dubai’s built the biggest man-made reefs with the palm islands and that, so it’s created a huge habitat.&quot; Artificial reefs can lead to a quick increase in the local fish population. They draw plankton which smaller fish can prey on which then attracts bigger fish suitable for fly fishing. One species drawn to the artificial reefs in Dubai is the queenfish. They can grow to be over a metre long and up to 15 kilograms, although most are about half that weight. This kind of fish is particularly good for fly fishing because of its visual takes and the fact it swims in schools. Fly fishing differs from more conventional spin fishing. Instead of having a heavy lure at the end of the fishing line, fly fishers have a fly which is lighter and less likely to scare away game. The fly stays on the surface of the water where fish will be attracted to it, thinking it is prey. With ocean fly fishing youre constantly on the move to find the next school of fish &quot;So you literally run - shoot, run - shoot.&quot; But the unique part of fly fishing in Dubai is the proximity to its skyline. Fly fishing is done close to the shore so anglers are surrounded by the citys landmarks.: the Burj Khalifa, the Burj Al Arab, Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina.</desc></programme>

This huge tree-shaped island was built from sand, rock and sheer determination. What keeps it all in place is this 11-kilometer breakwater crescent, lined with five-star hotels, this protective halo has two openings side that allows the famously clear blue waters to flow with the tide. Seventy-eight thousand residents call Palm Jumeirah home, living in luxury apartment blocks on the trunk and private gated estates on the fronds. Its also the address of some of Dubais most exclusive hotel accommodation from Anantaras overwater villas to Atlantiss underwater suites. Elsewhere at Skyline Defining Atlantis, there’s a world-class water park and a network of aquariums filled with 65000 inhabitants. And for a truly surreal experience, you can even walk among them. Or perhaps you prefer to fly? The latest way to get a birds eye view of this manmade megastructure in a gyrocopter. Similar to helicopters, two-seat aircraft reach heights of fifteen hundred feet. Another way to explore Palm Jumeirah is by sea, and the 78-kilometer shoreline is dotted with idyllic seaside destinations. &quot;Club Vista Mare is tucked away on the eastern trunk, very popular destination for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one ‘star’ attraction of Vista Mare is its pool in the sea,&quot; says Rebecca Rees. And the new Palm Tower will showcase a wraparound infinity pool on the 50th floor, providing unparalleled views of this iconic island.</desc></programme>

Nothing can prepare visitors for the true scale of record-breaking Burj Khalifa . At twice the height of the Empire State Building and almost three times the size of the Eiffel Tower, it soars 828 metres into the sky. Inside, there are 160 floors occupied by designer Giorgio Armani’s first-ever hotel , award-winning restaurants, luxury apartments and offices – and observation decks at levels 124, 125 and 148. Colourful wings, painted on observation deck windows, are designed for guests to pose between them. Part of the Global Angel Wings Project by Colette Miller, before appearing in Dubai, they were seen in Australia, China, Cuba, Europe, Kenya, Japan and the United States. The wings hint that humans can be angels of the earth and serve as a reminder to do good. Next door, The Dubai Mall houses more of Downtown Dubai’s supersized attractions. Visitors can cage-dive with sharks at the vast Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo and Dubai Mall’s indoor ice rink is an ample fit for professional figure skaters at 60 metres long; it can also snow here at the flick of a switch. While some attractions defy reality, others escape it altogether. Dubbed ‘The Centre of Now’, Downtown Dubai can take visitors to the future at the world’s largest VR Park in The Dubai Mall, a hive of virtual and augmented realities. Dubai in 2050 is the setting of indoor park’s augmented reality rollercoaster, made all the more exhilarating with headsets that place passengers in the cockpit of a computer-generated helicopter. As the virtual helicopter orbits out of the control, the very real, very fast rollercoaster cars plummet through loops and spin on their axes. Bustling with entertainment, Downtown Dubai’s high-octane epicentre is looped by the laidback, café-lined Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Boulevard – a starting point for a public art trail. Downtown Dubai is an urban canvas of sculptures</desc></programme>

With a fanbase of 20 million and growing, Duncan has been approached by various renowned companies, such as Line, Asus, and TVBS for creative collaborations. He uses a caricature of himself as the main protagonist in his comics, which are centered around the hilarious going-ons of his daily life. With the cameras rolling, he wears his character as a mask, not wishing to expose his face. He is about 5’3, with a skinny frame, his dyed blonde hair peeking out from behind his mask. “My father always objected to my interest in drawing, but my mother was rather supportive. Some of my most precious memories are of those childhood drawings. I would show them to my mother, deeply excited, and she would look at them and say, ‘Oh, that’s [a] really nice picture’, and then display it on the fridge using a magnet. And I would feel so proud every time she did this. I would think, ‘Wow, I need to draw more, because I want more things to be displayed on the fridge’, and then slowly…. the fridge got filled up. And the old drawings would be removed, and the whole process would be repeated. And this small matter, and that fridge, they influenced me, and allowed me to feel like perhaps I should continue drawing in the future.”On the other hand, Duncan’s father was a strict figure, quite the opposite of his mother. “My father never smiled at me from the day I was born till the day he passed away. He never genuinely smiled at me and was always kind of distant - he’s a very, very strict kind of father - so we never really talked much, and of course after I graduated from high school, I left home.” Like all typical Asian parents, Duncan’s father hammered the notion: ‘do not pursue art because you’ll starve to death’, and that if he became an artist, ‘you’ll only earn money after you’re dead’.During his university years, Duncan majored i</desc></programme>

Its a cafe attached to an actual Tteok museum (koreans take their rice cakes seriously) inside the old, traditional Insadong neighborhood. Nothing new or trendy but its actually one of those places that you may find yourself wandering back into after your initial bad attitude. The first floor houses the Tteok Cafe where one can essentially purchase and eat every variety of Tteok known to mankind pretty much. The textures and fillings are as varied as the many colors that are on display and its easy to mindlessly go into a tteok-frenzy but it pays to be selective because theres only so much glutinous rice hunks one can eat in one sitting and tteok is known to go stale quickly.When youve had your fill of colorful starch, head up to the 2nd floor where you can find the museum part of the experience and learn about the thousands of years of tteok history. And if youre wanting a little more action after, head on over to the traditional Korean Liquor Museum which is in the same building.In total, this place really is a hub for Koreas days of yore, including spreads on North Korean cuisine and what emperors have been served .

It’s a place that perfectly embodies old and new Tokyo, a university town that attracts more than students. It’s a great place to live (some even think it’s one of the best kept secrets of Tokyo) with just about everything you need in one place — restaurants, nightlife, shopping, and easy access to just about any other part of the city. While tall gleaming skyscrapers haven’t taken over the landscape like much of Tokyo, there’s a good balance of historical and contemporary architecture to keep things interesting.Walk around and you’ll find neighborhood pockets that focusing on one thing: an entire street of used bookstores, another with stores and stores hawking vintage and new guitars; a three-story mecca for old-school arcade games; an entire block for ski and snowboarding gear. You can find Michelin-starred restaurants, gyoza specialists, internationally known ramen shops, and even great burger joints around the corner from each other.

Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience. We like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Milk Tea Cake, Sriracha Street Corn, and Lemongrass Pork Chop. Although it will be a longer wait, do yourself a favor and go for dinner for the best experience.</desc></programme>

As an adventurer, author, sailor, Klondiker, journalist, playwright and social reformer. Jack’s exploits, love affairs, and political machinations were followed by newspapers throughout the world. Jack London not only bridged the gap between romantic and modern literature he was also a sensational photographer whose works appeared in the Hearst papers and magazines throughout the country. This documentary uses Jack’s photographic accounts of the Japanese-Russo War, the slums of London in 1902, The San Francisco Earthquake and the Mexican Revolution to illustrate his point of view. In April of 1907, Jack and Charmian London set sail for the South Seas, on the “Snark,” a boat, Jack designed and built. His photos, stories and articles on Hawaii and the South seas helped popularize surfing, boosted tourism, and provided the first view millions of Americans had of the beauties and tragedies of these islands and their indigenous peoples. One of the leading Socialists of his time, Jack wrote the introductions to and helped raise the money for Upton Sinclair’s book “The Jungle.” This book led to the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Jack was also instrumental in changing the copyright laws in America. Jack London died on November 22, 1916. Scholars still argue over whether London wittingly or unwittingly committed suicide with a self-induced overdose of morphine. or died from a stroke and heart failure.</desc></programme>

We kicked off our adventure in Eastern Sears Creek, making our first casts to see what the waters would yield. From there, we headed to South Lake for some laid-back pontoon trout fishing. After a relaxing day by the lake, complete with apple pie and cold beverages, we followed expert advice from Jared to venture back into the heart of nature. Our trek led us to Long Lake, nestled just above South Lake, offering more stunning views and fishing spots. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we&apos;re picking up where we left off. We&apos;ll dive deeper into understanding the lakes, figuring out what the rainbow and brook trout are biting on, and trying our best to land a few. Join us as our backcountry adventure continues</desc></programme>

With so much on the line shareholders happily pay these privileged men an women millions of dollars every year for their services. But they are still just employees, they come to work every day and go home like everyone else. So what do these people actually do all day? The real answer to what a CEO actually does is… whatever they want. Within the company they are only answerable to the board of directors and the only power that board of directors has over them is to decide their compensation package, or to fire them. The board of directors themselves are representatives of the companies’ shareholders and in a lot of small companies the biggest shareholder and the chairman of the board is also the CEO so the board can’t do anything apart from give advice and hope the CEO listens to it. That’s only for small companies though, it is INCREDIBLY rare for the CEO’s of public companies to have this much power, in fact there is only ONE company in the S&amp;P500 where the CEO can not be voted out by the board and that’s META’s Mark Zuckerberg since he owns a majority of a special type of share in the company. For every other CEO their only real job is to not get fired by the board. The best way to do that is to keep the board that represents the shareholders happy by delivering strong investment returns. Make line go up is a simple objective but it still doesn’t answer what they actually do all day since that goal can be achieved in so many different ways, but I have to make this video before Good Work makes a funnier, better version of it… again… So let’s imagine that you wake up one day in the body of a random Fortune Five Hundred CEO and you need to make it though the day without being found out, here are the things that ONLY a CEO can do from the moment they you walk into the office until the moment you leave… probably quiet late at night… The first task that ONLY a CEO is allowed t</desc></programme>

When two strange men in top hats disembark from their train, the hacks solicit them until they give in and ask for a ride to their castle. When the men stiff the fare, Tom and Jerry pursue them, only to be trapped inside the castle by a portcullis. They wander about the residence and encounter a fearsome-looking bat, a bathing, whistling skeleton, a veritable army of ghosts, and other assorted ghouls and goblins. After meeting a skeletal quartet in black-face, they find the two strange men again and discover they&apos;ve been turned into skeletons as well, after which they escape the castle and run for their lives.</desc></programme>

Chai Raja and Sundar are trying hard to keep them cool. To make matters worse a group of school students come with their class teacher as a part of their picnic. And the same time an ice-cream seller comes in front of the shop. Delighted, all the customers and the students flock around him to buy ice-cream. Chai Raja and Sundar are instantly out of customers and business. Totally frustrated, Chai Raja appoints Sundar to canvas the customers back to the hotel. Sundar tries to do some stupid performances to lure the kids back. But things take a twist when Basha teams up with the ice-cream seller. Now it is full on competition. And lets see who wins!</desc></programme>

Basha only adds to his woes as Basha deliberately keeps undoing all that Sundar does just so that the poor waiter of Hotel California stays distracted enough and cant chase the bothersome Basha off the premises. Sundar tries tacking a tarpaulin sheet but Basha naughtily shifts it to the entrance where the tarpaulin sheet takes on a mind of its own and customers find themselves ushered/plonked into the shop in unorthodox manners. Sundar runs to take it down and is also caught up by the stormy tarpaulin sheet. Finally, Sundar has it stuffed into the closet but then he finds that the wind has weakened one of the wooden posts and the roof may fall any second on the tea-sippers. Sundar tries his own (bad) handyman skills and drill nails to hold up the post, but Bashas interference leads to the post crumbling entirely. Desperate, Sundar stands in place of the post, holding the roof up- Basha tickles &amp; taunts Sundar and has a gala time. But the loyal Sundar sticks through it. Suddenly the storm seems to die and Sundar gingerly steps out of the spot- and quickly sticks in a pipe to hold up the roof it seems to be holding!! Relieved, he dashes to where Chai Raja has set out his supper and casually flicks a tiny baby coconut that had fallen in it aside...but this ricochets off the many already shaken up posts of the stall and in a trice the three posts of the stall are knocked down. The pipe creaks...then bends and as Sundar gulps, the last support of the roof too gives away and it comes crashing down! In the distance Basha chuckles and tucks in for the night.</desc></programme>

Basha is all set to sweep her off her dainty hairy feet but minutes before that Sundar, fumbling one of his deliveries trips on Chai Rajas new jackfruit dessert and ends up doing a complicated tappangutthumove ; which as fate would have it sits absolutely in tune with the music that played on the radio. The female monkey who until now looked comatose jerks to rapturous attention. She cant take her eyes off Sundar. Basha horrified at this unexpected attention-switch tries some classy Tango to woo her. Sundar though slightly irritated by the fawning female monkey, is amused at Bashas frustration there begins an impromptu dance off between Sundar and Basha. Sadly for Basha, all the suave leaps and twists dont seem to impress the damsel of his dreams. Sundar too is in danger of facing flak from Chai Raja for delivering more tappangutthuthan tea! Sundar knowingly trips up letting Basha win the affections of the lady finally...and a pleasant surprise from Basha awaits Sundar as he drags feet to wash the dishes!</desc></programme>

The naughty Basha manoeuvres Sundar into crashing past the barricade and upsetting the careful setup. The blustering bureaucrat is all set to throw a fit when suddenly he sees something and shrieks in childlike delight. Its a massive spider that often lurks about the tea-shop. Fishing out a delicate collectors glass case with exotic arachnids, the foreigner eagerly points at the one missing species that he has not yet managed to bag. He wants the spider Pronto! Chai Raja orders Sundar to nab said arachnid but Sundar is frankly freaked out. He gingerly sets about his task as the bureaucrat taps manicured fingers in impatience but finds its not going to be easy as Basha just to spite Sundar has decided to team up with the Tarantula and preserve the latters freedom. The tarantula in its turn, is no pushover and proves deft and spinning inventive webs that not only trap people but bounce them off or string them up etc. The many booby traps Sundar lays all backfire and finally end in bureaucrats glass case rupturing and the collected chasing the collector.

Chai Raja turns to find a beaming salesman selling buns who wants Chai Raja to take a trial batch of his buns. Chai Raja doesnt much care for the pushy salesman from the start, but really loses his temper when the salesman implies that his buns are better than Chai Rajas fritters. An incensed Chai Raja orders Sundar to take care of the salesman so that he himself can get on with the days menu, as customers have started coming. Sundar immediately gets his guard face on and sends the salesman scuttling though little does he know that the stubborn guy has snuck back into the yard and is keeping an eye out for an opportunity to thrust his trial buns in Chai Rajas face. The salesman spots Basha neatly outwitting Sundar and decides to recruit the latter to worm his way into Chai Rajas presence- the salesman wants to prove his point and force Chai Raja to buy his buns. Basha expecting fritters as payment accepts and gets to work distracting Sundar. The salesman sneaks in and starts switching the snacks and soon Chai Raja faces foul-tempered customers who point at their plates in protest. Sundar is immediately summoned and given an earful- a confused Sundar suddenly spots the lurking salesman and realizes who the saboteur is. A chase ensues made hilarious by Bashas intervention that Chai Raja ends by landing a griddle splat on the salesmans hindquarters and sending him flying.

En route the special package starts to leak unawares of Charlie who is too tired and stops for a “quick” nap after nearly bumping into the Doobydoos. Deedee and Nino are searching for Charlie and find him at long last. Dejected, Charlie calls himself the worst postman in the world having melted all of Tiggy’s vanilla ice-cream.

On hearing a scream, Charlie rushes in apologising for hitting Tiggy, but it turned out that Tiggy was moaning for what he read in the newspaper. It was about a contest of the Chef Challenge Award featuring whether Tiggy’s rival, Chef Alfonse could win it. Tiggy always wanted to win the challenge but never knew what original recipe to make. Tiggy gets jealous as he reads Chef Alfonse’s fish-a-la mode recipe that he promises to create the dish himself and if turns out to be really good as the newspaper says it is, he will admit how good his rival really is. So Tiggy waits a long while at the lake to catch a fresh fish as the recipe calls for it. Soon all his friends come over to help him fish, each with their very own fish lines. Seems a little magical assistance can help this time. But the lake is now occupied by one big playful dragon fish. The dragon fish turns out to be really hungry, so Tiggy sets out to make the biggest beetroot and berry snack ever. The dragonfish gulps it all down happily, but Deedee is sad she couldn’t really help Tiggy with the recipe. Tiggy on the other hand is quite ecstatic that he was able to whip up the most original dish ever. So over pancakes the next day Tiggy discovers that he has been awarded the annual Chef Challenge Award for the most original beetroot and berry recipe based on the photo and information Deedee gave to the judges.

Basha tries buttering up the Gurukkal- at first the lazy Sundar doesnt clue in but when he realizes that Basha plans to use the Kalari moves to chomp away the fries kept for the customers. Sundar decides (thought bubbles) to master the art himself and beat Basha before he can succeed. Now the Kalari Guru has two very-very interested/undesired disciples who are intent on learning- or not letting the other one learn- Kalari!

The next morning Mayor De Pfeffle polishes the Gardening Star to a shining bright sparkle, then sets off to inspect. Deedee and Nino find Mewmew trapped in her house strangled tight by huge beanstalks. The only way to pry her free would be to pluck all the beans off the stalks thanks to Tiggy’s suggestion on what to do.

Mewmew wishes her planes flew too so she asks Deedee to work some magic for her. So Deedee casts an ‘all day flying’ spell onto Mewmew’s plane but Nino comes in-between and gets hit by the spell on his helmet. Now Nino can’t stop flying and zooms away all over Abra-Dabra. He flies so wildly that he send Mayor De Pfeffle for a spin after knocking over his flower display. Nino is sorry for being so carried away that he tries to land, but to his surprise the helmet keeps pulling him skyward. Charlie tries weighing Nino down with his heavy mail bag, but the helmet is too strong for even Charlie to grab a hold of that Nino is flung away higher and farther. Nino promises to deliver the mail, much to the happiness of Charlie who can get a much deserved nap for all the effort. So begins Abra-Dabra’s very own first ‘air’-mail courtesy of Nino. Deedee comes up with a plan to help the ‘jet-lagged’ Nino after being inspired by the paper planes Mewmew makes. She shouts out to Nino to use a long sheet of paper from the mail bag and make a plane ‘Mewmew style’ with the wings pointing downwards. The plan works and Nino is able to fly right into Mewmew’s house and the magic wears-off as the sun sets in Abra-Dabra. In all the fuss Mewmew understands what made her planes not to fly, which actually helped Nino come down, and makes her paper planes fly so well now, thanks to Deedee.</desc></programme>

Charlie can’t stand the mess any more that he posts Sandy and Boris with the chore of tidying up the entire place before he gets back from his postman duties that day. Charlie furthers the chore by cautioning them that any toys that are not kept back in their rightful places will be given away, to which the twins sadly agree. But more than tidying, the twins set out messing up what Deedee and Nino are patiently helping them with. The twins neither want Uncle Charlie to give away any of their toys nor are they able to clean it up soon enough. It seems only Deedee’s magic can help them, much to the dismay of Nino. Not only do all the toys magically shut themselves in the toy chest, all of them are nowhere to be seen when Sandy peeps in. The spell seems to have been too strong that it made the toys clear away from the home of the twins and fall in different places all over Abra-Dabra, in Tiggy’s cooking pot, inside Mayor De Pfeffle’s shoe, in Mewmew’s garden, in the front yard of the Doobydoos, and everywhere else. They all set out to get the toys back for the twins but the toy zebra and the toy frog are nowhere to be seen. Finally they find them with the Doobydoos who think the toys belong to them.

And when the spell is cast, the recipe book opens up exactly at the recipe of a pie made of Tika Pila flowers. The problem is that only the Doobydoos can pick the Tika Pila flowers as it grows in the most prickly cacti in Abra-Dabra! But no matter how much Deedee and Nino coax Tiggy to work on another recipe; Tiggy is totally fixated on the Tika Pila flower pie. Though the Doobydoos love eating the flowers, they are too scared of the loud and angry Tika Pila monster that guards them and rush off in a hurry. They finally hit a bargain with Tiggy in exchange for a hundred custard sandwiches. Only with much reassuring and coaxing they pick every Tika Pila flower around. Mayor De Pfeffel is already at Tiggy’s and really hungry. But one Doobydoo is too ambitious and stays back to pick the last Tika Pila flower, but that awakes the Tika Pila monster and he shouts the biggest shout ever, scaring Tiggy and making the pie fly up high and splatter down on his face!

Intrigued, Sundar scoops up the sapling to a coconut shell and brings it to the hotel but is quickly divested off it as Chai Raja ushers him to clean up before turning in. Chai Raja sloshes his special night brew and some spills onto the plant. The plant shudders unnoticed by anyone, the brew boosting its growth so quickly...that by morning when Sundar wakes up he shrieks to find a massive venus fly trap in place of the small fragile sapling he had left the night before. Chai Raja though does freak out in the beginning does let Sundar keep the huge plant pet once he sees its adeptness at keeping the tables clean off flies, especially when rewarded with sips of tea! Basha finding the plant extremely quirky pranks it with pepper seeds and thats it. The plant now breathing fire chases after Basha himself. And Sundar is thrilled at first, but then things fly wrong as the plant starts wrecking the hotel. It is literally a war in the hotel and Sundar is at his wits end, so is Chai Raja. But Basha is having a good time, though the plant is impartial even towards Basha. Going into magic space.</desc></programme>

So she conjures a invisi-ball game. But the spell bounces off the ball and makes Nino invisible instead. Deedee is sad her spell went cuckoo on Nino, but Nino can’t stand her magic any more, so she checks out a remedy in her magic book and finds that the spell would cancel itself with three chimes of the town hall bell. Deedee decides to get Nino to the spot at the earliest. Nino scares the Doobydoos in his new ‘form’, but soon gets them to play along as he removes his helmet and is completely invisible now. Nino loves the fact that he is invisible and plays tricks on sleepy Charlie. Deedee sees the Doobydoos playing with the helmet and think they are throwing Nino about. But when she realizes that Nino isn’t in it, she is even more worried as the spell can become permanent if it isn’t cancelled soon. Nino has lots of fun playing pranks on Tiggy, Deedee, Charlie and Mewmew. Nino soon realizes that his pranks have gone out of hand that Mayor De Pfeffle announces over the loudspeaker to get Nino to come to them. Nino appears and is stubborn to stay invisible, so Deedee catches Nino with her hat and gets him in place to take full effect of the town hall chimes. Having regained his visibility, Nino agrees that a little magic is fun.</desc></programme>

But thinking of the possibility of the idea, Charlie tries a hand at throwing a newspaper onto Tiggy’s lawn, but ends up flying in through the window. On hearing a scream, Charlie rushes in apologising for hitting Tiggy, but it turned out that Tiggy was moaning for what he read in the newspaper. It was about a contest of the Chef Challenge Award featuring whether Tiggy’s rival, Chef Alfonse could win it. Tiggy always wanted to win the challenge but never knew what original recipe to make. Tiggy gets jealous as he reads Chef Alfonse’s fish-a-la mode recipe that he promises to create the dish himself and if turns out to be really good as the newspaper says it is, he will admit how good his rival really is. So Tiggy waits a long while at the lake to catch a fresh fish as the recipe calls for it. Soon all his friends come over to help him fish, each with their very own fish lines. Seems a little magical assistance can help this time. But the lake is now occupied by one big playful dragon fish. The dragon fish turns out to be really hungry, so Tiggy sets out to make the biggest beetroot and berry snack ever. The dragonfish gulps it all down happily, but Deedee is sad she couldn’t really help Tiggy with the recipe. Tiggy on the other hand is quite ecstatic that he was able to whip up the most original dish ever. So over pancakes the next day Tiggy discovers that he has been awarded the annual Chef Challenge Award for the most original beetroot and berry recipe based on the photo and information Deedee gave to the judges. Tiggy is delighted to see an appreciative comment by Chef Alfonse that Tiggy’s surprise-a-la dragonfish being totally top-notch.</desc></programme>

Deedee and Nino agree to help. They soon invite all of Abra-Dabra, but Tommy Prickles isn’t so keen on attending, because he feels so very shy. But as Deedee doesn’t have any spell to make Tommy’s shyness go away she improvises without magic by making Tommy believe that she has cast a spell on Tommy’s hat. Tommy agrees to attend the party in the guise that the hat he is wearing is now a chatter hat that will help him talk to others at the party. Nino is confused as he’s happy on one side that magic wasn’t used but sad that Tommy thinks magic is used. Tommy Prickles fits right in at the party and has fun playing with the Doobydoos and talks so freely and happily with everyone. Just then a huge gust of wind ruffles everything including Tommy’s hat. Poor sad Tommy feels so shy and helpless that he wants to go back home. But Deedee implores him to stay by trying to make him hopeful that Nino would return soon with Tommy’s hat. Tommy slumps on the ground and won’t budge, not until Deedee gets Tommy to don Tiggy’s baker hat. Tommy jumps springs back up and rounds all the party goers to teach them his very own special Wiggly Worm dance. Just then as they all dance in a bee-line behind Tommy, Nino flies in with Tommy’s hat. A confused Tommy discovers that he was wearing Tiggy’s hat till then and is flabbergasted to know that Deedee didn’t work any magic into the hat all along. Tommy Prickles runs away crying. Tommy reasons with Deedee that all of Abra-Dabra will think of him as silly, but Deedee tells him that if he couldn’t believe her, then to at least believe those who love having him along. Tommy looks up to see all his friends walking up to him doing the Wiggly Worm dance. Tommy takes a brave step and listens to his friends wanting have him back. He joins them just the way he is, without his ‘magic’ hat. Deedee finally agrees with Nino that sometimes no magic is good.</desc></programme>

Seems Deedee’s magic is the only answer. The spell she conjures makes Tiggy be totally decided on the recipe that he sees first. And when the spell is cast, the recipe book opens up exactly at the recipe of a pie made of Tika Pila flowers. The problem is that only the Doobydoos can pick the Tika Pila flowers as it grows in the most prickly cacti in Abra-Dabra! But no matter how much Deedee and Nino coax Tiggy to work on another recipe; Tiggy is totally fixated on the Tika Pila flower pie. Though the Doobydoos love eating the flowers, they are too scared of the loud and angry Tika Pila monster that guards them and rush off in a hurry. They finally hit a bargain with Tiggy in exchange for a hundred custard sandwiches. Only with much reassuring and coaxing they pick every Tika Pila flower around. Mayor De Pfeffel is already at Tiggy’s and really hungry. But one Doobydoo is too ambitious and stays back to pick the last Tika Pila flower, but that awakes the Tika Pila monster and he shouts the biggest shout ever, scaring Tiggy and making the pie fly up high and splatter down on his face! The inevitable terrible has happened and there is nothing to give the Mayor. Just then when things couldn’t get any worse Mayor De Pfeffel lunges inside and is happy to see a whole plate of his favourite custard sandwiches.</desc></programme>

Sadly they find out Mewmew is totally undecided as to what he has to create in the first place and time is ticking by. Deedee is all too excited to take a peek to see what Mewmew has finally decided to make but it stopped by Nino. Finally Mewmew asks Deedee to enter the enclosed work-space, but not to see the sculpture which is fully covered, but to help move it to the town square. The sculpture is heavy and tiring that Deedee has a tough time getting it there. Mayor De Pfeffle announces the exhibit to be revealed in a couple of minutes and Mewmew rushes under the covering to add a few finishing touches. Mewmew’s symbolises the theme ‘happiness’ by creating a basket of carrots and proudly brushes it to shine more. But as he is there he overhears his friends whispering about things that make them happy like the magic wand for Deedee, a hammock for Charlie and so on. As none of them see carrots as a sign of happiness, Mewmew is in a hurry to make something that will mean happiness to everybody. Having made it Mewmew requests Deedee to magically get the sculpture to town square in a jiffy. Deedee conjures a swapping spell but it makes both the sculptures disappear. So Deedee and friends decide to pose under the sheet in a manner that resembles the happiness sculpture the closest. Mayor De Pfeffle is getting impatient that he removes the covering to reveal all the friends hugging each other trying to console a sad Mewmew. Mayor De Pfeffle is excited to see a living statue that epitomises happiness in a ‘hug’. The townsfolk take turns to use the statue space to express happiness in their own way, life-size.</desc></programme>

And when the spell is cast, the recipe book opens up exactly at the recipe of a pie made of Tika Pila flowers. The problem is that only the Doobydoos can pick the Tika Pila flowers as it grows in the most prickly cacti in Abra-Dabra! But no matter how much Deedee and Nino coax Tiggy to work on another recipe; Tiggy is totally fixated on the Tika Pila flower pie. Though the Doobydoos love eating the flowers, they are too scared of the loud and angry Tika Pila monster that guards them and rush off in a hurry. They finally hit a bargain with Tiggy in exchange for a hundred custard sandwiches. Only with much reassuring and coaxing they pick every Tika Pila flower around. Mayor De Pfeffel is already at Tiggy’s and really hungry. But one Doobydoo is too ambitious and stays back to pick the last Tika Pila flower, but that awakes the Tika Pila monster and he shouts the biggest shout ever, scaring Tiggy and making the pie fly up high and splatter down on his face! The inevitable terrible has happened and there is nothing to give the Mayor.

On Deedee’s query as to what new learning Bella was into, they start discussing about Tika Pila and their joined curiosity to know more about the secretive creature by asking everybody in Abra-Dabra what they know about Tika Pila. Charlie seems to know a little, but the Doobydoos are too scared to even speak about her. But Bella is determined to know all she can about Tika Pila and sets off all geared for the expedition. She is scared out of her wits by the sudden and loud hooting of Tika Pila she runs for her life and slips to a halt right in front of Deedee and Nino. Almost when Bella is about to give up her Tika Pila discovery project, Deedee encourages her by helping Bella with some magic. Deedee casts a spell to help Bella get close enough to study Tika Pila. Strengthened by the spell, Bella gives one more try. Deedee and friends soon spot Tika Pila at town-hall. But as they admire how wonderful Tika Pila looks as she eats cacti flowers they hear her hoot very differently. Bella opines that the hoots are successively different because Tika Pila wants to go back home. Just then the Doodbydoos pass by and Tika Pila follows them. Deedee comes up with a plan to lure Tika Pila back to her home by getting the Doobydoos to follow Mayor De Pfeffle holding out a plate stacked with their favourite custard sandwiches. Deedee and Bella lay cacti flowers as well for Tika Pila to follow. On seeing the wide open cacti fields Tika Pila gives a loud and happy toot and makes a run for it. Bella is so happy that she decides that something as wonderful, mystical and magical as Tika Pila shouldn’t be studied.</desc></programme>

After getting a hint from Charlie on how much he loves chess, boris and sandy plan the birthday party around a ‘knights and castles’ theme. The twins get Deedee to bring balloons, a castle cake with turrets from Tiggy and a jousting dance from Mewmew. Boris and Sandy set out to decorate Uncle Charlie’s house, just in time for their friends coming in with all the goodies for the party. They even invent a balloon jousting game between Deedee and Mewmew that makes Mewmew crash into Tiggy’s cake and thereby wreck all the arrangements much to the dismay of the twins. This calls for Deedee’s magic where all the party ingredients are put into a large purple cauldron and it makes a gigantic bouncing castle in the chequerboard garden.

On hearing a scream, Charlie rushes in apologising for hitting Tiggy, but it turned out that Tiggy was moaning for what he read in the newspaper. It was about a contest of the Chef Challenge Award featuring whether Tiggy’s rival, Chef Alfonse could win it. Tiggy always wanted to win the challenge but never knew what original recipe to make. Tiggy gets jealous as he reads Chef Alfonse’s fish-a-la mode recipe that he promises to create the dish himself and if turns out to be really good as the newspaper says it is, he will admit how good his rival really is. So Tiggy waits a long while at the lake to catch a fresh fish as the recipe calls for it. Soon all his friends come over to help him fish, each with their very own fish lines. Seems a little magical assistance can help this time. But the lake is now occupied by one big playful dragon fish. The dragon fish turns out to be really hungry, so Tiggy sets out to make the biggest beetroot and berry snack ever. The dragonfish gulps it all down happily, but Deedee is sad she couldn’t really help Tiggy with the recipe. Tiggy on the other hand is quite ecstatic that he was able to whip up the most original dish ever. So over pancakes the next day Tiggy discovers that he has been awarded the annual Chef Challenge Award for the most original beetroot and berry recipe based on the photo and information Deedee gave to the judges.

Sadly they find out Mewmew is totally undecided as to what he has to create in the first place and time is ticking by. Deedee is all too excited to take a peek to see what Mewmew has finally decided to make but it stopped by Nino. Finally Mewmew asks Deedee to enter the enclosed work-space, but not to see the sculpture which is fully covered, but to help move it to the town square. The sculpture is heavy and tiring that Deedee has a tough time getting it there. Mayor De Pfeffle announces the exhibit to be revealed in a couple of minutes and Mewmew rushes under the covering to add a few finishing touches. Mewmew’s symbolises the theme ‘happiness’ by creating a basket of carrots and proudly brushes it to shine more. But as he is there he overhears his friends whispering about things that make them happy like the magic wand for Deedee, a hammock for Charlie and so on. As none of them see carrots as a sign of happiness, Mewmew is in a hurry to make something that will mean happiness to everybody. Having made it Mewmew requests Deedee to magically get the sculpture to town square in a jiffy. Deedee conjures a swapping spell but it makes both the sculptures disappear. So Deedee and friends decide to pose under the sheet in a manner that resembles the happiness sculpture the closest. Mayor De Pfeffle is getting impatient that he removes the covering to reveal all the friends hugging each other trying to console a sad Mewmew. Mayor De Pfeffle is excited to see a living statue that epitomises happiness in a ‘hug’. The townsfolk take turns to use the statue space to express happiness in their own way, life-size.</desc></programme>

Deedee and Nino are surprised to hear him sing and sets up a proposition for Mewmew to sing at the concert hall with Tiggy’s lemonade stand nearby. The concert is all set and so is Tiggy’s lemonade stand. Mewmew is parched with practising so long and is totally refreshed with Tiggy’s minty lemonade, but it turns out he’s got the hiccups. All the conjured tactics to beat the hiccups, including Tiggy’s super sour lemon lime sherbet fizzerade doesn’t seem to work. Only magic seems to stop this stubborn bout of hiccups in time for the concert. The spell works on Mewmew but backfires and the bubblecordion gets a fit of hiccups. Mewmew is so sad, but it turns out that the townsfolk are mesmerized by the bubbles. Alas, the bubbles are about to tip over Tiggy’s lemonade stand. Suddenly the blaring horns of Tika Pila gives everybody a shock of surprise, even the bubblecordion that the hiccups come to a halt. Now that the lemonade stand is safe, lemonade is served all around. Mewmew is all set for the concert, which surprisingly ends with a sneeze.</desc></programme>
