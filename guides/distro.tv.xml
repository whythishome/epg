It is the engine that brings you closer to the vision of yourself, overcoming challenges, fulfilling dreams and achieving goals that you thought were unattainable, like running a race in the middle of the desert. Your purpose drives you from the depths of your being, it becomes your obsession and inspires you to find time where it seemed nonexistent, will where there used to be excuses, and energy in places where there used to be apathy. Your purpose will guide you to become the person you always dreamed of being, lead you to live the authentic life you long for, and lift you to a state of greatness. The Škoda Titan Desert Morocco can be explained in many ways: through its route, its landscapes, its winners... but there is no better way to do it than through its people. Their stories. The Purpose is a documentary that brings together and delves into five of the stories we experienced in the 2024 edition of the race. Stories of passion, overcoming, love and courage. Because it is them: Martí, Jan, Michal, Alejandra, Daniel and Konny who make a mountainbike race much more than that. Let it be a vital experience that changes lives.</desc></programme>

Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart were two wildly different characters. She was a tenement girl from Aberdeen, who’d managed to claw her way out of what was obviously quite a hard upbringing, He was the kind of Wearside Durham Jack the Lad who was something of a musical prodigy. Annie studied the flute at the Royal Academy of Music but had to work as a waitress to get by. It was at her workplace that she was introduced to Dave Stewart through a mutual friend. They would soon form their first band, The Tourists The Tourists disbanded after legal issues between Pete Coombes and the label. It freed Annie and Dave, who wanted to expand their creativity further. Together they formed the Eurythmics and released their debut album, In the Garden. In the Garden achieved little commercial success and the duo chose to retreat to a small home studio in London’s Chalk Farm, where they were free to develop a new sound They began to work with synthesisers, a choice that would lead them to their breakthrough hit, Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This. The success of the single led to a re-release of Love is a Stranger. The band, now big on both sides of the Atlantic, had another hit on their hands. The band quickly worked on their follow-up album, Touch. It would become their first number one in the UK and produced a succession of hit singles. Touch also saw them experiment with even more musical styles Featuring archive material, music videos Who’s That Girl, Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) and, exclusive insights from music critics and journalists Michael Bonner (Uncut Magazine), Hamish MacBain (Shortlist), John Aizlewood (Evening Standard) Rock Legends Eurythmics tells the story of one of Britain’s enduring rock bands.</desc></programme>

In this performance, Les Dissonances present Johannes Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68. Brahms realized he was expected to compose a symphony that would match the musical standards established by Ludwig van Beethoven. After working on it for at least fourteen years, he completed his Symphony No. 1 in 1876. Brahms’s symphony was hailed as ‘Beethoven’s Tenth’: a worthy successor to Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9. Brahms’s work contains several references to Beethoven. For instance, the main theme of the fourth movement – first appearing in the strings – resembles the ‘Ode to Joy’ in the finale of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9.

Their efforts culminated in the performance of the composer’s complete repertoire for string quartet, which covers three decades of Beethoven&apos;s musical creativity, during six impressive concerts at Philharmonie de Paris in the autumn of 2020. Quatuor Ébène explored every facet of Beethoven&apos;s string quartet repertoire: from the youthful Opus 18 string quartets to the Razumovsky, Harp, and Serioso quartets (Opus 59, 74, and 95) from his middle period, and finally, the depth of his late quartets (Opus 127 to 135). This program features Quatuor Ébène performing Beethoven’s String Quartet No. 3 in D major, Op. 18 No. 3; String Quartet No. 11 in F minor, Op. 95, “Quartetto Serioso”; and String Quartet No. 8 in E minor, Op. 59, No. 2, &quot;Razumovsky&quot;.

When his fellow composer Gioachino Rossini died in 1868, Verdi proposed to compose a ‘Messa per Rossini’ in his honor, to be written by himself and several other Italian composers. Verdi wrote the concluding movement, ‘Libera me’. When the premiere was cancelled, the project lay dormant. When Italian poet Alessandro Manzoni passed away a few years later, Verdi revisited his plan to compose a requiem – this time in honor of the poet he so greatly admired. As an opera composer, Verdi knew better than anyone how to infuse the work with drama, as is evident in the revised version of his ‘Libera me’. The famous, powerful ‘Dies Irae’ especially stands out, depicting the horrors of the Last Judgement.</desc></programme>

The conductorless ensemble consists of musicians from the most prestigious European orchestras, international soloists, and young talents. In this performance, Les Dissonances perform Ludwig van Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67. Beethoven composed Symphony No. 5 between 1804 and 1808, completing the work at nearly the same time as his Symphony No. 6, ‘Pastorale’. Both symphonies premiered as part of an all-Beethoven program at the same concert on December 22, 1808. Symphony No. 5 has become one of the best-known compositions in classical music. It opens with the famous four-note motif, often interpreted as the musical manifestation of ’fate knocking at the door’. This rhythmic figure returns in various guises in the other three movements of the symphony. The second movement consists of a set of lyrical variations on two themes. The third movement begins gently, but leads to a blasting horn section presenting a theme that features the rhythmic pattern of the four-note motif. The movement leads uninterrupted to the fourth movement that features a triumphant finale ending in C major. This performance was recorded at Philharmonie de Paris, France, in 2015.</desc></programme>

With the exception of the first violin concerto, Mozart composed his other four violin concertos in 1775 at a time when he was concertmaster at the Salzburg court. It is the third and final movement that gives Concerto No. 5 its nickname, the ‘Turkish Concerto’. This movement features a striking middle section of ‘Turkish music’, which the composer achieves not only by changing the meter, and the mode to minor, but also by letting the cellos and basses play col legno - creating a percussive sound with the wood of their bow. This performance was recorded at Cité de la Musique, France, in 2014.</desc></programme>

After all, fellow composers Ludwig van Beethoven and Anton Bruckner died before writing their tenth symphonies. Mahler’s Symphony No. 9 premiered on June 26, 1912, in Vienna, performed by the Vienna Philharmonic led by Bruno Walter. Unfortunately, the composer himself did not live to see this: he died in 1911.

Several concerts from his 1966 European tour were recorded for television, featuring his quartet of Charles Rouse (tenor saxophone), Lawrence Gales (bass) and Benjamin Riley (drums). His quartet performed Epistrophy, &apos;Round Midnight, and Lulu&apos;s Back in Town in Warsaw for Polish television on April 4, 1966.

He arrived in Memphis in the late 1940s, where his cousin Bukka White taught him the tricks of the blues. Soon he developed his own style. King’s virtuoso, narrative solos with lots of vibrato, have been an inspiration for most (rock) guitarists after him.</desc></programme>

Not Another Black Movie is not only a spoof of a genre often associated with Tyler Perry films, but a satirical look at family dysfunction as well. Written by Jay Davis and Directed by Donte &quot;Diesel&quot; Williams, Not Another Black Movie addresses issues that effect many families whether they be rich or poor, black or white. Although we poke fun at some of the stereotypical roles portrayed in this genre, we hope to shed some light on problems that plague many families while giving you a good laugh.</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

It’s a place that perfectly embodies old and new Tokyo, a university town that attracts more than students. It’s a great place to live (some even think it’s one of the best kept secrets of Tokyo) with just about everything you need in one place — restaurants, nightlife, shopping, and easy access to just about any other part of the city. While tall gleaming skyscrapers haven’t taken over the landscape like much of Tokyo, there’s a good balance of historical and contemporary architecture to keep things interesting.Walk around and you’ll find neighborhood pockets that focusing on one thing: an entire street of used bookstores, another with stores and stores hawking vintage and new guitars; a three-story mecca for old-school arcade games; an entire block for ski and snowboarding gear. You can find Michelin-starred restaurants, gyoza specialists, internationally known ramen shops, and even great burger joints around the corner from each other. With friendly and fiercely proud locals who want to share the area’s history, from origami to the Kanda Myojin Shrine, this is a quieter part of Tokyo just waiting to be discovered.</desc></programme>

Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience. We like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Milk Tea Cake, Sriracha Street Corn, and Lemongrass Pork Chop.

This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: &quot;The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below 80 percent in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals.&quot; Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: &quot;It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve.&quot; iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc></programme>

There arent many meals that can claim royal lineage dating back almost a thousand years to the ancient emperors of China. Known as Peking Duck, Beijing Duck or Chinese Roast Duck , this dish is a signature staple of the city and you could spend weeks soul searching and taste testing your way through a variety of recipes (yes, even KFC has one).  To save you time, Duck de Chine is one of the annual contenders for the best roast duck in the land and offers an extravagant dining experience. An impressive and inviting décor, complete with vermillion fabrics, dazzling chandeliers, cozy brick walls and large round tables, offers a luxury setting to indulge in the local specialty. Whether you enjoy sugar or spice, a variety of delicious sides accompany the glistening moist meat of this whole duck, prepared over the open flames of 60 year old Jujube wood. Pro tip: dip the crispy skin directly in the raw sugar and enjoy the ride. Smaller dishes, a separate dim sum menu and a full champagne bar are also available so set aside plenty of time to plant yourself in this beautiful dining room and feast away like its 1330.</desc></programme>

It may involve a puddle of beans next to over-sauced enchiladas. It may involve yellow cheese and crunchy shells. It may involve trucks and outdoor salsa bars. It most likely does not involve crispy skinned pork belly studded with pungent elephant garlic and elegantly strewn with radish sprouts and micro herbs. But maybe it should.Chef Ray Garcia—a born-and-bred Angeleno—is on the forefront of the modern Mexican food movement thats taking over the city, and Broken Spanish is his swanky flagship. The aforementioned CHICHARRON is one of the best large-format meat dishes in a 50-mile radius, while the LAMB NECK TAMAL is all gamey funk and pillowy tender masa. For dessert, the CAFE DE OLLA is a Mexican firing squad of chocolate, beer, and coffee to the face.

Located just north of Fort Lauderdale, this quiet beach town is perfect for those who prefer less crowds and a laid back atmosphere. It’s ideal location makes access to other South Florida towns, including Miami, super easy. I start my journey at the Fort Lauderdale Marriott Pompano Beach Resort &amp; Spa. It has the most amazing sunrises which I delighted in each day from my private balcony. The hotel is located directly on the beach which makes it very difficult to leave. I visit the charming beachside town of Lauderdale by the Sea, a 10 minute drive from my hotel. I also take a tour at Butterfly World, the first and largest butterfly house in the United States. It is home over 80 species of butterflies, hummingbird and lorikeet aviaries, and outdoor gardens. This place is truly magical for people of all ages. Pompano Beach is the quintessential beach town.

Vanessa’s restaurant celebrates delicious dishes and memorable moments. She talks us through her inspiration behind what is one of Taipei’s most warm and authentic French dining experiences.Interview: Vanessa HuangActually our restaurant is unlike others in Taiwan, in that our menu is different everyday. We make adjustments based on our daily findings at the market, and we design our menu around that. For example, if we see really fresh seafood or vegetables or meat, we’ll put that on the menu.I can’t really say that I have one signature dish, and even when our guests keep coming week after week asking for a specific dish, I get bored of making the same thing and will want to move on to something else. What I like is giving our guests something new every time.A very special moment for me is when my parents go to the fields themselves and handpick ingredients for me, like lemongrass, lily flower root, etc, and I’ll use them to make ice cream or appetizers. And the part that makes me most proud and happy is when I get to tell our customers, ‘this was handpicked by my mom!’. But of course, it doesn’t happen often, only sometimes when the chance arises.I went to France at the end of 2002, to attend the cooking school, Ferrandi. At the time I just wanted to have my own little coffee shop, like most young girls. But one day my chef, my mentor at the school, asked me if I wanted to do a stage (internship) at a 3 starred Michelin restaurant, he thought it was a great opportunity for me. I agreed, not even knowing what Michelin was, and that experience would go on to change my life.Being the only female and foreigner student during my stage, I didn’t want to lose to everyone else, and I would push myself to keep up. Although it was daunting and disheartening when I couldn’t understand my teacher, I continued to give it my all, and at the time I felt like maybe I was working harder than othe</desc></programme>

Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc></programme>

Taiwan saw a rise in abandoned animals during the 1980’s, during a time of economic growth. Residents who were uninformed of the responsibilities that comes with raising a pet, eventually abandoned said animals on the streets. Today, we have invited Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor, model and humanitarian, to interview the Director of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The setting is at the Zhonghe Animal Shelter, a place that has truly become a haven for stray dogs in recent years.Operating under the government of New Taipei City, Zhonghe Animal Shelter seeks to provide unwanted dogs with the safest and best care they can afford. Upon entering their care, every animal will be given vaccination, a health screening, de-worming, microchip implantation, and are spayed or neutered. Depending on their gender, male dogs will receive a mark on the left ear, while females are marked on the right ear. Once the process is finished, these dogs are ready for adoption.While there are other breeds at the animal shelter, their stay is never long since they get adopted rather swiftly, leaving the shelter with a 90 majority of the Formosan Mountain Dog, or more simply known as, Taiwanese Dog. The characteristics of the Taiwanese dog breed include a triangular face, agile feet that are known for their hopping skill, and a sickle tail. The personality of the Formosan is loyal, intelligent, affectionate and understanding. “These dogs are suited for being hunting or search dogs, so the current feeding rate for these dogs is quite high. We mainly have black ones, but we also have brown and yellow ones,” says the Director.Currently, most, if not all the dogs at the Shelter have been desexed. This ‘zero-kill’ plan started on the 1st of March last year, under the guidance of the mayor of New Taipei City, Zhu Li Luen. Howeve</desc></programme>

About the size of 60 rugby fields, it has been created to give visitors some green space and a better understanding of Islamic beliefs. Inside the park’s orchards and Glass House, visitors can discover a variety of healthy and medicinal flora featured in the Holy Quran, from pomegranates and olives, to figs and garlic. Another attraction at Quranic Park is the Cave of Miracles, where seven miracles recounted in the Holy Quran play out on the walls. &quot;The cave was amazing,&quot; says Usman, who is visiting from the UK. &quot;We learnt a lot about the miracles growing up, it just gave another understanding to it. And it was great to visualise it, not just hear about it.&quot; &quot;This is an open example that the Quran is not just to read in order to get reward but it is something that can be in practical life,&quot; says Anwar, a visitor from the US. &quot;This place is beautiful and a very interesting experience for children. Here, they can actually experience things from the Quran,&quot; says Miteab, who lives in Saudi Arabia.  Al Shindagha Perfume House From aromatic flora to the UAE’s first museum dedicated to fragrance. The Al Shindagha museum is home to the  Perfume House . Part of a complex created to gather, preserve and share Emirati heritage, Perfume House charts the history and role of fragrance in the region. Rashed Almuhairi is Perfume House’s Chief Cultural Guide.  “It’s special and important not only for the guests who are coming, he tells Euronews. &quot;It’s for our own generations also. A lot of our youth, they didn’t live in many things like perfuming or pearl diving, so it’s important that they know about our past life. Dubai has a very rich history which needs to be told.” One of the more unusual exhibits on display is a 28 kilogramme piece of oud.

From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer. She says putting photos on Instagram is all about social capital. “You want to present something that is aspirational,&quot; she explains. &quot;It has to be well-framed. It has to be colourful – dark pictures don’t do so well on Instagram. So, you’re looking for something that is bright, that real</desc></programme>

Michela Colella, Operations Manager, Divers Down UAE said, &quot;We will go to an average depth of 14 metres. We’ll look for trumpet fish, triggerfish, clownfish, pufferfish, boxfish.&quot; Even with the basic training completed, diving with an instructor helps you feel safer, develop the right habits, and take in all the best spots on the dive site. Some of the most spectacular coral and marine life are located just 5 metres from the surface. At that depth, everything is lit up beautifully and the air lasts much longer than at 10 or 15 metres. The reef has species ranging from stingrays to lobsters, jawfish, parrotfish, broomtail wrasse, and many others. For more experienced divers there are dozens of shipwrecks and artificial reefs to explore each with unique histories and coral formations.

The countrys most thriving food scene is here, run by a guerilla band of ethnically diverse chefs cooking up whatever they want, wherever they want, with the best produce in the world. From the industrial warehouses east of downtown to the beachside shopping meccas of Venice, LAs cutting edge street style, art scene, and culinary chops cant be contained—the creative energy pops through the concrete like ficus roots.

Around the world, aging populations, rising healthcare costs, and pressures on the insurance industry have created opportunities for destinations like Dubai , that have been able to invest rapidly in their healthcare infrastructure and capitalise on the sharp increase in demand for health tourism. Encouraging international institutions Dr Marwan Mohamed Al Mulla, CEO, Health Regulation Sector, Dubai Health Authority said, “Recently a new law has come into effect which encourages and allows international institutions to have their own, 100 percent ownership The Dubai Health Authority has had a medical tourism strategy in place since 2014 with the aim of developing and supporting its healthcare sector and steadily increasing its contribution towards Dubais gross domestic product. Focusing on an inbound patient’s airport-to-airport needs has helped providers capitalise too. Dr Basel Nasrallah, Medical Director, Armada said, “We in our facility, for example, get about 5 percent more patients from abroad. Patients are coming from all around the world. We are receiving patients from Russia, mainly Europe, Italy, Spain, UK, and North America from Africa, from South Asia Why have health checks in Dubai? Interestingly, many of those countries are known for the strength of their own medical tourism offerings, but Dubai is still an attractive option for patients who are looking to combine their treatments with other pursuits. Alexander Edwards, Surgical Patient, from the UK said, “Well there were multiple aspects I looked at prior to coming obviously looking at the time it takes, for the recovery period.

This sought-after holiday destination encompasses the coastal neighbourhood of Jumeirah Beach Residence, known locally as JBR, home to retail and entertainment developments The Walk and The Beach, which multiple the attractions for fun-seekers. Iconic five-star hotels hug the shoreline, their vast marble lobbies leading to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunches and postcard-perfect beaches. Le Méridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is one of the longest-standing hotels in Dubai Marina with 500 metres of private Arabian Gulf coastline providing a playground for water sports enthusiasts. Local expats regularly fill the resort’s Barasti bar, restaurant and beach club. A Dubai institution in its second decade, this well-liked venue has grown into a sprawling sports and beach bar with open-air screenings and food stalls, and the only free-entry beach club in town. Despite progression, Barasti retains its original theme, defined by palm fronds typically found in the traditional barasti shelters favoured by the early Bedouins. Other Dubai Marina beach clubs that draw crowds include Drift to Zero Gravity . Drift is dizzyingly beautiful; its pool deck, a catwalk for the latest swimwear fashions. Open until late, Zero Gravity is known for its high-octane parties and voyeuristic glass-sided pool. Sun worshippers on Dubai Marina’s deep sandy beaches pose for photos that frame its remarkable urban skyline. It’s a backdrop that’s hard to miss, containing some of the tallest residential towers in the world. The 101-storey Princess Tower once claimed the title of the highest, while the Cayan Tower retains its record for the world’s tallest building with a 90-degree twist; it’s structure akin to a giant corkscrew.

La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club, Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free. La Mer’s shops focus on beach pursuits and accessories, making it a good place to shop for swimwear, sunglasses, suntan lotion</desc></programme>

In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the worlds largest vegan restaurant (‘Veganity’) has just opened its doors. Veganity’s founder Sky Sommer’s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice. With over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer’s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt. “Its actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.” Below weve provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home.

She walks us through her inspiration for what now has become a staple experience for locals and global travellers.Interview: NAMIE OSAWA I opened Robot Restaurant three years ago. Even though I was hesitant to show the first concept to foreigners and so forth, I decided to open the restaurant in Kabukicho with the Japanese Businessman in mind. When thinking about what would be appealing to a businessman, I thought about Robots - which I longed for as a kid,..and Girls in sexy costumes. These were the things that initially came to mind. Our rehearsals begin at 11 o’clock in the morning including Wadaiko, which is a Japanese drum dance. We practice for about an hour and thirty minutes, then we have a brief meeting before the show. Rehearsals can be tough, but whatever we go over, ..it’s amazing and we have fun and I think it’s very good. Still, I think that there is a part where not a lot of the content catches on with the audience. Even after repeated viewings, I would like to think that each show was better than the one before it. But on the name alone, people were intrigued and when it arrived, it was beyond the imagination because I wanted it to be a thoughtful experience.

Chef Musabbeh first served up a traditional dish - king rice. Its name comes from its historically prestigious status as an expensive dish only eaten by royalty or the rich. &quot;Liver is there, beef is there, saffron rice is there. So it’s all luxury things. I have cooked saffron rice, I have fried cauliflower, boiled chickpeas.

Coming from big hotels, he initially wanted the kitchen to be very serious, less smiling, less interactive, etc..I never agreed with this, so we had to find a balance. And it took almost a year until we found that balance,...after he saw the happy customers and atmosphere we knew we were on to something and it because very harmonic. There is never an argument between the kitchen and the staff, and it’s amazing. This is a very big achievement..norma</desc></programme>

In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep - took off in one from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring. “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.” Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.” Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc></programme>

With over a billion people watching, Beijing seems to manage the task with dignified ease. The pace of life in this city speaks volumes about its personality and its characters. The mood is steady, confident, and proud.  With walls that never end, ducks that bear golden skin, and Forbidden Cities out in the open, Beijing has a storybook magic that can only be found in a megacity overflowing with such rich history and tradition. The landmarks and landscapes are dominant forces, followed by the new developments mounted by modernization. Knowing where to look will be the key to unlocking the cities best adventures and experiences. Don’t be afraid to explore the many interesting nooks and crannies of Beijing’s streets and alleys, as there are many. From the bucket list worthy monuments, to the waves of new restaurants, shops, and cultural encounters available, be sure not to rush. Beijing is a hotbed of commerce and entrepreneurship, and inspires the country’s top artists, students, writers, film-makers, musicians, and creatives to converge within its frontiers. With so much to explore in one of the oldest cities on the planet, traveling somewhere else seems irresponsible - there’s no place like ‘the capital.’</desc></programme>

No more. We can easily go up to 12,000 feet. In case we have an engine failure, it’s just doing this (Jos turns off engine).&quot; Paramotors are one of the smallest aircraft in the world and have a great safety record because the engine is only needed for gaining altitude and can be switched off when you come back down to land. &quot;We will do a spiral.

For just one dirham, abra rides provide boatloads of nostalgia while travelling between the souks and museums of Deira and Bur Dubai. These heritage hubs recall the Bedouins’ humble and ancient past built on pearls, and then shaped by a free trade boom that brought new settlers to the creek in the early 1900’s. Echoing that era, today’s expats – some descendants of those early traders – share authentic flavours from their homelands in a culinary kaleidoscope that compliments Emirati fare. Popular food tours Food tours are a popular way to explore Dubai Creek. Arva Ahmed is the founder of Frying Pan Adventures. She describes one of the restaurants that features on the tours itinerary. &quot;One of the restaurants we stop on our tour is called Sultan Dubai Falafel,&quot; she says. &quot;And the thing that they are known for is stuffed falafels. They stuff them with chilli, onion and sumac. These falafels are the most juiciest most filled with herbs and fragrant falafels that you’re going to find in the city.&quot; Deira’s Waterfront market is piled high with technicolour fruit and vegetables and stacks of shellfish with legs choreographed in chorus-line unison. Here you can buy the catch of the day and have it cooked in many different ways for old-school Creekside dining. Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary Until recently, the creek ended at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary. Here nature lovers can spot flamingos that migrate to the Sanctuary, a wetland extension of the creek spread over 6.2 sq.km. It features a variety of mangroves and lagoons perfect for migrating birds - the sanctuary is home to over 180 species of birds. Following its expansion as Dubai Canal, the creek curves past book-shaped Mohammed Bin Rashid Library, high-rise Business Bay and beach-hugging Jumeirah before it’s reunited with its source - the glittering Arabian Gulf.</desc></programme>

A report by the United Nations earlier this year claimed animal extinctions are at an unprecedented high. According to the organisation, as many as one million species are under threat. On a visit to the desert, you might expect to find camels or antelope, maybe some hawks. But Dubai’s Al Marmoom animal sanctuary is teeming with biodiversity with hundreds of different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The sanctuary covers 20 percent of the whole area of Dubai. In the beginning, it was a desert populated by native animals, but as the sanctuary expanded to more than 50 oases, it was discovered  these water bodies could control the environmental balance. The sanctuary has even managed to attract the Arabian Oryx. This animal was declared extinct in the wild in 1972, but has now been brought back from the brink by the reserve. Saoud Faisal is a wildlife officer at the Al Marmoom sanctuary. He says in the 80s and 90s the Oryx were overhunted for food. Now the animal is considered part of the regions wildlife. “They are totally protected now and also they are healthy,” he explains. “We have them in large numbers which last year reached more than 500.&quot; From desert oases to indoor tropical environments, recent laws in Dubai mean greater governmental support for animal sanctuaries. Laws were introduced in 2007 to cover animal welfare, but awareness really started to build in 2016. The laws also apply to rare and exotic animals. Some are looked after in animal sanctuaries like Green Planet. Everything about Green Planet was designed specifically to create the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals in the middle of the Dubai desert. The sanctuary houses a wide range of species including many different birds, and mammals such as two-toed sloths. And lizards like green iguanas or basilisks. The latest addition t</desc></programme>

But, in fact, its history goes back more than 5,000 years. Archaeologists have unearthed a series of exciting and mysterious discoveries across the Emirate. These include the Jumeirah Archaeological site, which dates back to the Abbasid Period in the 10th century AD, to the Saruq Al Hadid site – a centre for human inhabitants and trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600-2000 BCE) to the Iron Age. When the Jumeirah Archaeological site was discovered, experts noticed that the walls of the buildings there were plastered. Dr Mansour Boraik, an archaeology specialist from Dubai, said: &quot;It was plastered inside and outside with white plaster. When they tried to picture the city during the Abbasid Period, and they imagined that it would look like a white city from the shores of the Gulf.&quot; The site shows Dubai during the Abbasid period which is around the 10th century AD. The geographical location of the site is important. It sits on the shoreline of Dubai but also on the major trade route between Mesopotamia, India and Oman. It also sits in-between the Arabic and Indian peninsular. The 80,000 square metre site sits in the shadow of the Burj Khalifa and the imposing Dubai skyline, emphasising the comparison between old and new worlds. The circular and semi-circular tower supports reflect the prosperity of the inhabitants of the time who will have been a mixture of locals and passing tradesmen. A variety of silver coins, pottery, copper, glass and stone artefacts have been excavated. Its one of the largest and most important Islamic sites ever discovered in the Gulf. It is also home to the oldest Mosque discovered in the UAE. Saruq al Hadid Saruq al Hadid is regarded as the jewel in the crown of archaeological discoveries In Dubai. This ancient industrial metallurgical centre dates back to the Iron Age and indicates that Dubai was a global trading hub.

You can charter a private yacht, hop onboard an organised boat tour - or you can even cross the marina for as little as €2 in a water taxi. Five-star resorts hug the coastline. Their vast, marble-clad lobbies lead to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunch venues and postcard-perfect beaches. As for Dubai Marinas beach clubs, from Drift to Zero Gravity , they are dizzyingly beautiful; their pool decks are catwalks for the latest swimwear fashions.

Home to Alserkal Avenue – actually a block of streets lined with some of the best art galleries in Dubai – Al Quoz is full of surprises. There’s more than world-class art hidden behind Al Quozs vast landscape of warehouses; where theres art, theres life, after all – and life here is vibrant. Just about every enterprise in Al Quoz comes with an exciting twist; for example, Al Quoz restaurant and speciality coffee bar Café Rider  doubles as a custom motorbike store. Mirzam , meanwhile, is an artisan chocolate factory thats also a café, located in the neighbourhood’s central art hub,  Alserkal Avenue . Alserkal Avenue cafes are defined by their fair-trade principles and creative concoctions that echo the area’s artistic character. From golden turmeric lattes to immune-boosting vegan matcha bowls, menus are bursting with goodness. Things to do in Alserkal Avenue and neighbouring complex, The Courtyard, include inspiring workshops; there are several to choose between. At  Oo La Lab , a fragrance mixology studio in Alserkal Avenue, you can learn how to create your own signature cologne.

Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash.

It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials. The eco packaging company Avani is one firm offering plastic-free alternatives, including a bag made from cassava, a cheap and common root vegetable. The material is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea. Peter Avram, managing director of Avani Middle East, said: “Until a c</desc></programme>

But Ocean Active Fly has re-imagined this scene - offering urban fly fishing right in the middle of Dubai. This is the first fly fishing operation in the Middle East. The founder, Nick Bowles, explained to Euronews why fishing there are fishing opportunities in Dubai: &quot;Dubai’s built the biggest man-made reefs with the palm islands and that, so it’s created a huge habitat.&quot; Artificial reefs can lead to a quick increase in the local fish population. They draw plankton which smaller fish can prey on which then attracts bigger fish suitable for fly fishing. One species drawn to the artificial reefs in Dubai is the queenfish. They can grow to be over a metre long and up to 15 kilograms, although most are about half that weight. This kind of fish is particularly good for fly fishing because of its visual takes and the fact it swims in schools. Fly fishing differs from more conventional spin fishing. Instead of having a heavy lure at the end of the fishing line, fly fishers have a fly which is lighter and less likely to scare away game. The fly stays on the surface of the water where fish will be attracted to it, thinking it is prey. With ocean fly fishing youre constantly on the move to find the next school of fish &quot;So you literally run - shoot, run - shoot.&quot; But the unique part of fly fishing in Dubai is the proximity to its skyline. Fly fishing is done close to the shore so anglers are surrounded by the citys landmarks.: the Burj Khalifa, the Burj Al Arab, Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina.</desc></programme>

Looking at her million-watt smile now, little would one have guessed that Liya also went through a dark period in her life. When she won the ELLE Model Look competition back in 2005, at the very height of her career, she bid farewell to the life of glitz and glamour and moved to Shanghai to live a quiet life of marital bliss with her then-newly-wed husband, Lin Yongchao. Just two years into the marriage, the once happy couple divorced and went their separate ways. The period that followed was a downward spiral that Liya finds hard to look back upon even now. Yet, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she found a new burning passion that reawakened her zest for life - her love of fitness and exercise.Today, Liya has taken time out of her day to tell us her story and recent endeavors. With smooth, sun-kissed skin and minimal make up, Liya flashes us her pearly-whites that remind us of the famous Disney character, Pocahontas. Growing up, becoming a model never crossed Liya’s mind. She perceived her tanned skin and naturally curly hair as against the norm of what was considered aesthetically beautiful, and was naturally surprised when she was approached by a stylist while strolling in Ximending, one of Taipei’s popular shopping districts. The stylist asked her to go in for a casting at Eelin, the model management company in which she is currently still signed to today. As it was Summer break and she had little to do, Liya decided to go to the casting with little expectations, and thus unwittingly began her fifteen-year-long career.It wasn’t all smooth sailing from there, especially the first couple of years into the modelling business. Liya found herself trying to be someone else, fitting into the mold of the successful models before her, afraid to stand out and be herself. Her skin tone, her h</desc></programme>

And this centuries’ old exclave of Dubai also caters for today’s health conscious traveller. High up in the Hajar mountains you can soak up the history while doing a spot of hiking. There are 32 kilometres of track in the area. More than a dozen possible routes have been mapped out, with four different levels of ability. Kayaking is also on offer on the vast lake next to the Hatta dam. Fitness expert and Youtube star Lilly Sabri @lillysabri says the walking is an ideal complement to a regular routine. “I think that when you’re on a holiday you want to make memories as well… so trying different things,” she says. “So, if you’re someone goes to the gym wherever you normally train and in whatever country that might be, it might be nice to try something different. So, getting outside. You certainly couldn’t do this in London where I’m originally from. So, it’s keeping fit and healthy but in a different way.” Wellness tourism has evolved to become the travel industry’s fastest growing sector – something Dubai is continuing to expand upon and develop. Across town amongst the shimmering Jumeirah Lakes Towers you will find the SMSF Heartfulness Meditation Centre. It’s the only one of its kind in the MENA region and they hold daily meditation classes that attract up to 500 people. “I think we just forgot where... we’ve been so focused on external gratification... now people are actually zoning in and they realise what’s important on how we feel and how we can impact on those around us,” says fitness expert Christian Williams. “This place in Dubai is not just where people live, it’s a stop off where people go on vacation. So, what we’re doing here in Heartfulness Meditation is just incredible not just for people living here but anyone who is willing to come and travel.

Camel races Old meets new can be seen at Dubais Camel Racing Club where these ships of the desert sprint across the perimeter of the famed Al Mamoom racetrack. Attracting both camel owners and punters alike, spectators can sit in their cars and drive alongside the camels as they hurtle towards the finish line, guided by a remote control jockey. Organisers say the event is a draw for tourists for a number of reasons. “When tourists come to the camel racing venues, they see something new. They see how people treat the camels and how the camels compete with each other. They also see how Emirati society promotes camels, says the clubs CEO and General Amanager Ali Saeed Bin Saroud. Camel racing was promoted by the former UAE president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as a way of bringing camels and back into mainstream Dubai culture. The Dubai Royal Family also actively support camel racing as a way of preserving the traditional Bedouin culture. Desert culture The Al Marmoom Heritage Festival is Dubai’s annual celebration of the traditional Arabian desert culture and vital role which it plays in the cultural identity of its people. Traditional markets, music and dancing are another way in which the Bedouin culture is kept alive and enjoyed by Dubai locals and tourists alike. Arabic hospitality German expat Ursula Musch moved to Dubai around 20 years ago after first visiting in 1993. She now breeds camels and encourages tourists to experience the Bedouin customs for themselves, as they, like her, may just find their passion in life. My passion or my message is I want to give foreigners, other people the chance to know something from the Arabic hospitality, from their tradition, from their culture, to show it to give it to other people who don’t</desc></programme>

What keeps it all in place is this 11-kilometer breakwater crescent, lined with five-star hotels, this protective halo has two openings side that allows the famously clear blue waters to flow with the tide. Seventy-eight thousand residents call Palm Jumeirah home, living in luxury apartment blocks on the trunk and private gated estates on the fronds. Its also the address of some of Dubais most exclusive hotel accommodation from Anantaras overwater villas to Atlantiss underwater suites. Elsewhere at Skyline Defining Atlantis, there’s a world-class water park and a network of aquariums filled with 65000 inhabitants. And for a truly surreal experience, you can even walk among them. Or perhaps you prefer to fly? The latest way to get a birds eye view of this manmade megastructure in a gyrocopter. Similar to helicopters, two-seat aircraft reach heights of fifteen hundred feet. Another way to explore Palm Jumeirah is by sea, and the 78-kilometer shoreline is dotted with idyllic seaside destinations. &quot;Club Vista Mare is tucked away on the eastern trunk, very popular destination for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one ‘star’ attraction of Vista Mare is its pool in the sea,&quot; says Rebecca Rees. And the new Palm Tower will showcase a wraparound infinity pool on the 50th floor, providing unparalleled views of this iconic island.</desc></programme>

Nothing can prepare visitors for the true scale of record-breaking Burj Khalifa . At twice the height of the Empire State Building and almost three times the size of the Eiffel Tower, it soars 828 metres into the sky. Inside, there are 160 floors occupied by designer Giorgio Armani’s first-ever hotel , award-winning restaurants, luxury apartments and offices – and observation decks at levels 124, 125 and 148. Colourful wings, painted on observation deck windows, are designed for guests to pose between them. Part of the Global Angel Wings Project by Colette Miller, before appearing in Dubai, they were seen in Australia, China, Cuba, Europe, Kenya, Japan and the United States. The wings hint that humans can be angels of the earth and serve as a reminder to do good. Next door, The Dubai Mall houses more of Downtown Dubai’s supersized attractions. Visitors can cage-dive with sharks at the vast Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo and Dubai Mall’s indoor ice rink is an ample fit for professional figure skaters at 60 metres long; it can also snow here at the flick of a switch. While some attractions defy reality, others escape it altogether. Dubbed ‘The Centre of Now’, Downtown Dubai can take visitors to the future at the world’s largest VR Park in The Dubai Mall, a hive of virtual and augmented realities. Dubai in 2050 is the setting of indoor park’s augmented reality rollercoaster, made all the more exhilarating with headsets that place passengers in the cockpit of a computer-generated helicopter. As the virtual helicopter orbits out of the control, the very real, very fast rollercoaster cars plummet through loops and spin on their axes. Bustling with entertainment, Downtown Dubai’s high-octane epicentre is looped by the laidback, café-lined Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Boulevard – a starting point for a public art trail. Downtown Dubai is an urban canvas of sculptures</desc></programme>

With a fanbase of 20 million and growing, Duncan has been approached by various renowned companies, such as Line, Asus, and TVBS for creative collaborations. He uses a caricature of himself as the main protagonist in his comics, which are centered around the hilarious going-ons of his daily life. With the cameras rolling, he wears his character as a mask, not wishing to expose his face. He is about 5’3, with a skinny frame, his dyed blonde hair peeking out from behind his mask. “My father always objected to my interest in drawing, but my mother was rather supportive. Some of my most precious memories are of those childhood drawings. I would show them to my mother, deeply excited, and she would look at them and say, ‘Oh, that’s [a] really nice picture’, and then display it on the fridge using a magnet. And I would feel so proud every time she did this. I would think, ‘Wow, I need to draw more, because I want more things to be displayed on the fridge’, and then slowly…. the fridge got filled up. And the old drawings would be removed, and the whole process would be repeated. And this small matter, and that fridge, they influenced me, and allowed me to feel like perhaps I should continue drawing in the future.”On the other hand, Duncan’s father was a strict figure, quite the opposite of his mother. “My father never smiled at me from the day I was born till the day he passed away. He never genuinely smiled at me and was always kind of distant - he’s a very, very strict kind of father - so we never really talked much, and of course after I graduated from high school, I left home.” Like all typical Asian parents, Duncan’s father hammered the notion: ‘do not pursue art because you’ll starve to death’, and that if he became an artist, ‘you’ll only earn money after you’re dead’.During his university years, Duncan majored i</desc></programme>

Its a cafe attached to an actual Tteok museum (koreans take their rice cakes seriously) inside the old, traditional Insadong neighborhood. Nothing new or trendy but its actually one of those places that you may find yourself wandering back into after your initial bad attitude. The first floor houses the Tteok Cafe where one can essentially purchase and eat every variety of Tteok known to mankind pretty much. The textures and fillings are as varied as the many colors that are on display and its easy to mindlessly go into a tteok-frenzy but it pays to be selective because theres only so much glutinous rice hunks one can eat in one sitting and tteok is known to go stale quickly.When youve had your fill of colorful starch, head up to the 2nd floor where you can find the museum part of the experience and learn about the thousands of years of tteok history. And if youre wanting a little more action after, head on over to the traditional Korean Liquor Museum which is in the same building.In total, this place really is a hub for Koreas days of yore, including spreads on North Korean cuisine and what emperors have been served . Just make sure you come brave enough to try the dried manta ray.</desc></programme>

It’s a place that perfectly embodies old and new Tokyo, a university town that attracts more than students. It’s a great place to live (some even think it’s one of the best kept secrets of Tokyo) with just about everything you need in one place — restaurants, nightlife, shopping, and easy access to just about any other part of the city. While tall gleaming skyscrapers haven’t taken over the landscape like much of Tokyo, there’s a good balance of historical and contemporary architecture to keep things interesting.Walk around and you’ll find neighborhood pockets that focusing on one thing: an entire street of used bookstores, another with stores and stores hawking vintage and new guitars; a three-story mecca for old-school arcade games; an entire block for ski and snowboarding gear. You can find Michelin-starred restaurants, gyoza specialists, internationally known ramen shops, and even great burger joints around the corner from each other. With friendly and fiercely proud locals who want to share the area’s history, from origami to the Kanda Myojin Shrine, this is a quieter part of Tokyo just waiting to be discovered.</desc></programme>

Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience. We like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Milk Tea Cake, Sriracha Street Corn, and Lemongrass Pork Chop.

This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: &quot;The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below 80 percent in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals.&quot; Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: &quot;It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve.&quot; iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc></programme>

Known as Peking Duck, Beijing Duck or Chinese Roast Duck , this dish is a signature staple of the city and you could spend weeks soul searching and taste testing your way through a variety of recipes (yes, even KFC has one).  To save you time, Duck de Chine is one of the annual contenders for the best roast duck in the land and offers an extravagant dining experience. An impressive and inviting décor, complete with vermillion fabrics, dazzling chandeliers, cozy brick walls and large round tables, offers a luxury setting to indulge in the local specialty. Whether you enjoy sugar or spice, a variety of delicious sides accompany the glistening moist meat of this whole duck, prepared over the open flames of 60 year old Jujube wood. Pro tip: dip the crispy skin directly in the raw sugar and enjoy the ride. Smaller dishes, a separate dim sum menu and a full champagne bar are also available so set aside plenty of time to plant yourself in this beautiful dining room and feast away like its 1330.</desc></programme>

But maybe it should.Chef Ray Garcia—a born-and-bred Angeleno—is on the forefront of the modern Mexican food movement thats taking over the city, and Broken Spanish is his swanky flagship.

She talks us through her inspiration behind what is one of Taipei’s most warm and authentic French dining experiences.Interview: Vanessa HuangActually our restaurant is unlike others in Taiwan, in that our menu is different everyday. We make adjustments based on our daily findings at the market, and we design our menu around that. For example, if we see really fresh seafood or vegetables or meat, we’ll put that on the menu.I can’t really say that I have one signature dish, and even when our guests keep coming week after week asking for a specific dish, I get bored of making the same thing and will want to move on to something else. What I like is giving our guests something new every time.A very special moment for me is when my parents go to the fields themselves and handpick ingredients for me, like lemongrass, lily flower root, etc, and I’ll use them to make ice cream or appetizers. And the part that makes me most proud and happy is when I get to tell our customers, ‘this was handpicked by my mom!’. But of course, it doesn’t happen often, only sometimes when the chance arises.I went to France at the end of 2002, to attend the cooking school, Ferrandi. At the time I just wanted to have my own little coffee shop, like most young girls. But one day my chef, my mentor at the school, asked me if I wanted to do a stage (internship) at a 3 starred Michelin restaurant, he thought it was a great opportunity for me. I agreed, not even knowing what Michelin was, and that experience would go on to change my life.Being the only female and foreigner student during my stage, I didn’t want to lose to everyone else, and I would push myself to keep up. Although it was daunting and disheartening when I couldn’t understand my teacher, I continued to give it my all, and at the time I felt like maybe I was working harder than othe</desc></programme>

Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc></programme>

Taiwan saw a rise in abandoned animals during the 1980’s, during a time of economic growth. Residents who were uninformed of the responsibilities that comes with raising a pet, eventually abandoned said animals on the streets. Today, we have invited Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor, model and humanitarian, to interview the Director of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The setting is at the Zhonghe Animal Shelter, a place that has truly become a haven for stray dogs in recent years.Operating under the government of New Taipei City, Zhonghe Animal Shelter seeks to provide unwanted dogs with the safest and best care they can afford. Upon entering their care, every animal will be given vaccination, a health screening, de-worming, microchip implantation, and are spayed or neutered. Depending on their gender, male dogs will receive a mark on the left ear, while females are marked on the right ear. Once the process is finished, these dogs are ready for adoption.While there are other breeds at the animal shelter, their stay is never long since they get adopted rather swiftly, leaving the shelter with a 90 majority of the Formosan Mountain Dog, or more simply known as, Taiwanese Dog. The characteristics of the Taiwanese dog breed include a triangular face, agile feet that are known for their hopping skill, and a sickle tail. The personality of the Formosan is loyal, intelligent, affectionate and understanding. “These dogs are suited for being hunting or search dogs, so the current feeding rate for these dogs is quite high. We mainly have black ones, but we also have brown and yellow ones,” says the Director.Currently, most, if not all the dogs at the Shelter have been desexed. This ‘zero-kill’ plan started on the 1st of March last year, under the guidance of the mayor of New Taipei City, Zhu Li Luen. Howeve</desc></programme>

About the size of 60 rugby fields, it has been created to give visitors some green space and a better understanding of Islamic beliefs. Inside the park’s orchards and Glass House, visitors can discover a variety of healthy and medicinal flora featured in the Holy Quran, from pomegranates and olives, to figs and garlic. Another attraction at Quranic Park is the Cave of Miracles, where seven miracles recounted in the Holy Quran play out on the walls. &quot;The cave was amazing,&quot; says Usman, who is visiting from the UK. &quot;We learnt a lot about the miracles growing up, it just gave another understanding to it. And it was great to visualise it, not just hear about it.&quot; &quot;This is an open example that the Quran is not just to read in order to get reward but it is something that can be in practical life,&quot; says Anwar, a visitor from the US. &quot;This place is beautiful and a very interesting experience for children. Here, they can actually experience things from the Quran,&quot; says Miteab, who lives in Saudi Arabia.  Al Shindagha Perfume House From aromatic flora to the UAE’s first museum dedicated to fragrance. The Al Shindagha museum is home to the  Perfume House . Part of a complex created to gather, preserve and share Emirati heritage, Perfume House charts the history and role of fragrance in the region.

A lot of our youth, they didn’t live in many things like perfuming or pearl diving, so it’s important that they know about our past life.

From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer. She says putting photos on Instagram is all about social capital. “You want to present something that is aspirational,&quot; she explains. &quot;It has to be well-framed. It has to be colourful – dark pictures don’t do so well on Instagram. So, you’re looking for something that is bright, that real</desc></programme>

When it comes to Taiwan and food, experts and enthusiasts alike know that they go hand-in-hand.  It is no wonder Taipei is overflowing with electricity as new ideas and re-imagined classics are popping up all over town. This magical friction is a big reason Taipei’s food scene is attracting young talent from the world’s best kitchens looking to experiment, innovate, and test their ideas against the discerning palates of the local crowds.  Highlighted by some of the world’s best produce, great transportation, magnificent hiking trails 5 minutes from downtown, a vibrant nightlife, and an openness towards travelers and new faces makes Taipei one of Black Buddha’s favorite cities.</desc></programme>

Los Angeles spent years striving to emulate towns like New York or San Francisco, but over the last decade the city took a long hard look in the mirror, dug what it saw, and started focusing on what it does best: casual, multicultural, and effortlessly cool.The new LA is the place everyone suddenly wants to be, where high and low converge on palm-lined sidewalks. The countrys most thriving food scene is here, run by a guerilla band of ethnically diverse chefs cooking up whatever they want, wherever they want, with the best produce in the world. From the industrial warehouses east of downtown to the beachside shopping meccas of Venice, LAs cutting edge street style, art scene, and culinary chops cant be contained—the creative energy pops through the concrete like ficus roots.

Around the world, aging populations, rising healthcare costs, and pressures on the insurance industry have created opportunities for destinations like Dubai , that have been able to invest rapidly in their healthcare infrastructure and capitalise on the sharp increase in demand for health tourism. Encouraging international institutions Dr Marwan Mohamed Al Mulla, CEO, Health Regulation Sector, Dubai Health Authority said, “Recently a new law has come into effect which encourages and allows international institutions to have their own, 100 percent ownership The Dubai Health Authority has had a medical tourism strategy in place since 2014 with the aim of developing and supporting its healthcare sector and steadily increasing its contribution towards Dubais gross domestic product. Focusing on an inbound patient’s airport-to-airport needs has helped providers capitalise too. Dr Basel Nasrallah, Medical Director, Armada said, “We in our facility, for example, get about 5 percent more patients from abroad. Patients are coming from all around the world. We are receiving patients from Russia, mainly Europe, Italy, Spain, UK, and North America from Africa, from South Asia Why have health checks in Dubai? Interestingly, many of those countries are known for the strength of their own medical tourism offerings, but Dubai is still an attractive option for patients who are looking to combine their treatments with other pursuits. Alexander Edwards, Surgical Patient, from the UK said, “Well there were multiple aspects I looked at prior to coming obviously looking at the time it takes, for the recovery period.

This sought-after holiday destination encompasses the coastal neighbourhood of Jumeirah Beach Residence, known locally as JBR, home to retail and entertainment developments The Walk and The Beach, which multiple the attractions for fun-seekers. Iconic five-star hotels hug the shoreline, their vast marble lobbies leading to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunches and postcard-perfect beaches. Le Méridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is one of the longest-standing hotels in Dubai Marina with 500 metres of private Arabian Gulf coastline providing a playground for water sports enthusiasts. Local expats regularly fill the resort’s Barasti bar, restaurant and beach club. A Dubai institution in its second decade, this well-liked venue has grown into a sprawling sports and beach bar with open-air screenings and food stalls, and the only free-entry beach club in town. Despite progression, Barasti retains its original theme, defined by palm fronds typically found in the traditional barasti shelters favoured by the early Bedouins. Other Dubai Marina beach clubs that draw crowds include Drift to Zero Gravity . Drift is dizzyingly beautiful; its pool deck, a catwalk for the latest swimwear fashions. Open until late, Zero Gravity is known for its high-octane parties and voyeuristic glass-sided pool. Sun worshippers on Dubai Marina’s deep sandy beaches pose for photos that frame its remarkable urban skyline. It’s a backdrop that’s hard to miss, containing some of the tallest residential towers in the world. The 101-storey Princess Tower once claimed the title of the highest, while the Cayan Tower retains its record for the world’s tallest building with a 90-degree twist; it’s structure akin to a giant corkscrew.

La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club, Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free. La Mer’s shops focus on beach pursuits and accessories, making it a good place to shop for swimwear, sunglasses, suntan lotion</desc></programme>

In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the worlds largest vegan restaurant (‘Veganity’) has just opened its doors. Veganity’s founder Sky Sommer’s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice. With over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer’s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt. “Its actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.” Below weve provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home.

Namie’s futuristic robot-inspired venue is as visually stimulating as it is entertaining and interactive. She walks us through her inspiration for what now has become a staple experience for locals and global travellers.Interview: NAMIE OSAWA I opened Robot Restaurant three years ago. Even though I was hesitant to show the first concept to foreigners and so forth, I decided to open the restaurant in Kabukicho with the Japanese Businessman in mind. When thinking about what would be appealing to a businessman, I thought about Robots - which I longed for as a kid,..and Girls in sexy costumes. These were the things that initially came to mind. Our rehearsals begin at 11 o’clock in the morning including Wadaiko, which is a Japanese drum dance. We practice for about an hour and thirty minutes, then we have a brief meeting before the show. Rehearsals can be tough, but whatever we go over, ..it’s amazing and we have fun and I think it’s very good. Still, I think that there is a part where not a lot of the content catches on with the audience. Even after repeated viewings, I would like to think that each show was better than the one before it. But on the name alone, people were intrigued and when it arrived, it was beyond the imagination because I wanted it to be a thoughtful experience. Always keep going forward, it’s what we want out of this show. I want to make sure there’s more to it than just a name.</desc></programme>

The meal that follows is known as Iftar, and you do not have to be Muslim to partake in one. In this edition of Taste, Euronews visited the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Hotel in Dubai, to sample the special Iftar menu produced by the worlds first Emirati chef. After Athan, the call for evening prayer, Muslims who have been fasting all day can finally eat and drink. The fast is broken by first eating dates. This is of great religious significance, chef Musabbeh Al Kaabi explained. &quot;Prophet Mohammed used to do this when he was breaking his fast, so we always break it with the dates then laban (a fermented milk drink) or water,&quot; he said. Chef Musabbeh first served up a traditional dish - king rice. Its name comes from its historically prestigious status as an expensive dish only eaten by royalty or the rich. &quot;Liver is there, beef is there, saffron rice is there. So it’s all luxury things. I have cooked saffron rice, I have fried cauliflower, boiled chickpeas. Now I need to take the flavour of the onions with all these things,&quot; Chef Musabbeh said as he prepared the dish. &quot;I will put the rice in now. I’ll put some spices in as well. So now, I’m going to put it on a plate, and I’m going to garnish it&quot; But, before eating, everyone said Bismillā, which means in the name of Allah. Chef Musabbeh then prepared his second dish the famous Emirati ouzi with oriental rice, a lamb dish with cinnamon and cardamom.

His passion for authenticity and obsession for comfort, pours out every minute you spend here. This place has a charming personality and we went directly to the source.Interview: MARCO BETTIOWhen I came here 10 years ago and started to do some consulting. I started to receive a lot of guests from all around the world..and I was always forced to bring them to fine dining places. I noticed that my clients weren’t really comfortable in the fine dining experience the first day they arrived in Shanghai.That’s what moved me to bring this real Italian dining experience to this area. I would say that we would always try to give a tailormade type of service. Greeting everybody, making them feel comfortable, it’s one of the most important things for us.Actually, “Goodfellas”..is meant to mean “good friends”..and this is the idea. There is no ego, there is no name of the chef, or my name on the door,..nothing but “Goodfellas.” It’s a place to for a good time with your friends, business partners, clients..to have an intimate experience in an enjoyable way.Chef Antonio is a great master, we actually call him “the maestro”,..it’s the italian way to address a very experienced chef. Since day one, Chef has been in charge of everything inside the kitchen...scouting the best ingredients and creating the recipes. Coming from big hotels, he initially wanted the kitchen to be very serious, less smiling, less interactive, etc..I never agreed with this, so we had to find a balance. And it took almost a year until we found that balance,...after he saw the happy customers and atmosphere we knew we were on to something and it because very harmonic. There is never an argument between the kitchen and the staff, and it’s amazing. This is a very big achievement..norma</desc></programme>

In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep - took off in one from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring. “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.” Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.” Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc></programme>

With over a billion people watching, Beijing seems to manage the task with dignified ease. The pace of life in this city speaks volumes about its personality and its characters. The mood is steady, confident, and proud.  With walls that never end, ducks that bear golden skin, and Forbidden Cities out in the open, Beijing has a storybook magic that can only be found in a megacity overflowing with such rich history and tradition. The landmarks and landscapes are dominant forces, followed by the new developments mounted by modernization. Knowing where to look will be the key to unlocking the cities best adventures and experiences. Don’t be afraid to explore the many interesting nooks and crannies of Beijing’s streets and alleys, as there are many. From the bucket list worthy monuments, to the waves of new restaurants, shops, and cultural encounters available, be sure not to rush. Beijing is a hotbed of commerce and entrepreneurship, and inspires the country’s top artists, students, writers, film-makers, musicians, and creatives to converge within its frontiers. With so much to explore in one of the oldest cities on the planet, traveling somewhere else seems irresponsible - there’s no place like ‘the capital.’</desc></programme>

No more. We can easily go up to 12,000 feet. In case we have an engine failure, it’s just doing this (Jos turns off engine).&quot; Paramotors are one of the smallest aircraft in the world and have a great safety record because the engine is only needed for gaining altitude and can be switched off when you come back down to land. &quot;We will do a spiral. If you can’t hold it anymore James, you just shout.&quot; &quot;Now we do a 360 to the right. Yalla, here we go!&quot; &quot;The G-force in your stomach is class!&quot; says OHagan.

For just one dirham, abra rides provide boatloads of nostalgia while travelling between the souks and museums of Deira and Bur Dubai. These heritage hubs recall the Bedouins’ humble and ancient past built on pearls, and then shaped by a free trade boom that brought new settlers to the creek in the early 1900’s. Echoing that era, today’s expats – some descendants of those early traders – share authentic flavours from their homelands in a culinary kaleidoscope that compliments Emirati fare. Popular food tours Food tours are a popular way to explore Dubai Creek. Arva Ahmed is the founder of Frying Pan Adventures. She describes one of the restaurants that features on the tours itinerary. &quot;One of the restaurants we stop on our tour is called Sultan Dubai Falafel,&quot; she says. &quot;And the thing that they are known for is stuffed falafels. They stuff them with chilli, onion and sumac. These falafels are the most juiciest most filled with herbs and fragrant falafels that you’re going to find in the city.&quot; Deira’s Waterfront market is piled high with technicolour fruit and vegetables and stacks of shellfish with legs choreographed in chorus-line unison. Here you can buy the catch of the day and have it cooked in many different ways for old-school Creekside dining. Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary Until recently, the creek ended at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary. Here nature lovers can spot flamingos that migrate to the Sanctuary, a wetland extension of the creek spread over 6.2 sq.km. It features a variety of mangroves and lagoons perfect for migrating birds - the sanctuary is home to over 180 species of birds. Following its expansion as Dubai Canal, the creek curves past book-shaped Mohammed Bin Rashid Library, high-rise Business Bay and beach-hugging Jumeirah before it’s reunited with its source - the glittering Arabian Gulf.</desc></programme>

A report by the United Nations earlier this year claimed animal extinctions are at an unprecedented high. According to the organisation, as many as one million species are under threat. On a visit to the desert, you might expect to find camels or antelope, maybe some hawks. But Dubai’s Al Marmoom animal sanctuary is teeming with biodiversity with hundreds of different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The sanctuary covers 20 percent of the whole area of Dubai. In the beginning, it was a desert populated by native animals, but as the sanctuary expanded to more than 50 oases, it was discovered  these water bodies could control the environmental balance. The sanctuary has even managed to attract the Arabian Oryx. This animal was declared extinct in the wild in 1972, but has now been brought back from the brink by the reserve. Saoud Faisal is a wildlife officer at the Al Marmoom sanctuary. He says in the 80s and 90s the Oryx were overhunted for food. Now the animal is considered part of the regions wildlife. “They are totally protected now and also they are healthy,” he explains. “We have them in large numbers which last year reached more than 500.&quot; From desert oases to indoor tropical environments, recent laws in Dubai mean greater governmental support for animal sanctuaries. Laws were introduced in 2007 to cover animal welfare, but awareness really started to build in 2016. The laws also apply to rare and exotic animals. Some are looked after in animal sanctuaries like Green Planet. Everything about Green Planet was designed specifically to create the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals in the middle of the Dubai desert. The sanctuary houses a wide range of species including many different birds, and mammals such as two-toed sloths. And lizards like green iguanas or basilisks. The latest addition t</desc></programme>

But, in fact, its history goes back more than 5,000 years. Archaeologists have unearthed a series of exciting and mysterious discoveries across the Emirate. These include the Jumeirah Archaeological site, which dates back to the Abbasid Period in the 10th century AD, to the Saruq Al Hadid site – a centre for human inhabitants and trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600-2000 BCE) to the Iron Age. When the Jumeirah Archaeological site was discovered, experts noticed that the walls of the buildings there were plastered. Dr Mansour Boraik, an archaeology specialist from Dubai, said: &quot;It was plastered inside and outside with white plaster. When they tried to picture the city during the Abbasid Period, and they imagined that it would look like a white city from the shores of the Gulf.&quot; The site shows Dubai during the Abbasid period which is around the 10th century AD. The geographical location of the site is important. It sits on the shoreline of Dubai but also on the major trade route between Mesopotamia, India and Oman. It also sits in-between the Arabic and Indian peninsular. The 80,000 square metre site sits in the shadow of the Burj Khalifa and the imposing Dubai skyline, emphasising the comparison between old and new worlds. The circular and semi-circular tower supports reflect the prosperity of the inhabitants of the time who will have been a mixture of locals and passing tradesmen. A variety of silver coins, pottery, copper, glass and stone artefacts have been excavated. Its one of the largest and most important Islamic sites ever discovered in the Gulf. It is also home to the oldest Mosque discovered in the UAE. Saruq al Hadid Saruq al Hadid is regarded as the jewel in the crown of archaeological discoveries In Dubai. This ancient industrial metallurgical centre dates back to the Iron Age and indicates that Dubai was a global trading hub.

Their vast, marble-clad lobbies lead to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunch venues and postcard-perfect beaches. As for Dubai Marinas beach clubs, from Drift to Zero Gravity , they are dizzyingly beautiful; their pool decks are catwalks for the latest swimwear fashions.

Home to Alserkal Avenue – actually a block of streets lined with some of the best art galleries in Dubai – Al Quoz is full of surprises. There’s more than world-class art hidden behind Al Quozs vast landscape of warehouses; where theres art, theres life, after all – and life here is vibrant. Just about every enterprise in Al Quoz comes with an exciting twist; for example, Al Quoz restaurant and speciality coffee bar Café Rider  doubles as a custom motorbike store. Mirzam , meanwhile, is an artisan chocolate factory thats also a café, located in the neighbourhood’s central art hub,  Alserkal Avenue . Alserkal Avenue cafes are defined by their fair-trade principles and creative concoctions that echo the area’s artistic character. From golden turmeric lattes to immune-boosting vegan matcha bowls, menus are bursting with goodness. Things to do in Alserkal Avenue and neighbouring complex, The Courtyard, include inspiring workshops; there are several to choose between. At  Oo La Lab , a fragrance mixology studio in Alserkal Avenue, you can learn how to create your own signature cologne. Or, just across the road, you can join an art class in Dubai’s popular community art space  thejamjar . Going strong for 15 years, thejamjar is a regular host of Alserkal Avenue events and art lessons, teaches budding artists of all ages several disciplines, from painting with oils to acrylic techniques. Tilika D’Souza, an art instructor at thejamjar, says the wellbeing of the participants is also important to the foundation: &quot;We have a workshop called  Intuitive Creativity  that combines meditation and art; we use all kinds of different art materials and we do a little meditation to begin with, so everybody is really relaxed during and after the class.&quot; For those who prefer to shop, tempting retail options include independent boutiques, such as Chi-Ka , a</desc></programme>

Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash. If you think you have a samurai spirit, this should feel like home.</desc></programme>

Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension.

It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials. The eco packaging company Avani is one firm offering plastic-free alternatives, including a bag made from cassava, a cheap and common root vegetable. The material is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea. Peter Avram, managing director of Avani Middle East, said: “Until a c</desc></programme>

In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the worlds largest vegan restaurant (‘Veganity’) has just opened its doors. Veganity’s founder Sky Sommer’s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice. With over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer’s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt. “Its actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.” Below weve provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home.

Looking at her million-watt smile now, little would one have guessed that Liya also went through a dark period in her life. When she won the ELLE Model Look competition back in 2005, at the very height of her career, she bid farewell to the life of glitz and glamour and moved to Shanghai to live a quiet life of marital bliss with her then-newly-wed husband, Lin Yongchao. Just two years into the marriage, the once happy couple divorced and went their separate ways. The period that followed was a downward spiral that Liya finds hard to look back upon even now. Yet, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she found a new burning passion that reawakened her zest for life - her love of fitness and exercise.Today, Liya has taken time out of her day to tell us her story and recent endeavors. With smooth, sun-kissed skin and minimal make up, Liya flashes us her pearly-whites that remind us of the famous Disney character, Pocahontas. Growing up, becoming a model never crossed Liya’s mind. She perceived her tanned skin and naturally curly hair as against the norm of what was considered aesthetically beautiful, and was naturally surprised when she was approached by a stylist while strolling in Ximending, one of Taipei’s popular shopping districts. The stylist asked her to go in for a casting at Eelin, the model management company in which she is currently still signed to today. As it was Summer break and she had little to do, Liya decided to go to the casting with little expectations, and thus unwittingly began her fifteen-year-long career.It wasn’t all smooth sailing from there, especially the first couple of years into the modelling business. Liya found herself trying to be someone else, fitting into the mold of the successful models before her, afraid to stand out and be herself. Her skin tone, her h</desc></programme>

No more. We can easily go up to 12,000 feet. In case we have an engine failure, it’s just doing this (Jos turns off engine).&quot; Paramotors are one of the smallest aircraft in the world and have a great safety record because the engine is only needed for gaining altitude and can be switched off when you come back down to land. &quot;We will do a spiral. If you can’t hold it anymore James, you just shout.&quot; &quot;Now we do a 360 to the right. Yalla, here we go!&quot; &quot;The G-force in your stomach is class!&quot; says OHagan. Flying over a stretch of desert reserve, you can see an array of wildlife; families of camels, Arabian oryx and even a tower of giraffes. &quot;After that, I think I can safely say that I’ve got over my fear of flying and kiss the ground,&quot; says OHagan.</desc></programme>

Namie’s futuristic robot-inspired venue is as visually stimulating as it is entertaining and interactive. She walks us through her inspiration for what now has become a staple experience for locals and global travellers.Interview: NAMIE OSAWA I opened Robot Restaurant three years ago. Even though I was hesitant to show the first concept to foreigners and so forth, I decided to open the restaurant in Kabukicho with the Japanese Businessman in mind. When thinking about what would be appealing to a businessman, I thought about Robots - which I longed for as a kid,..and Girls in sexy costumes. These were the things that initially came to mind. Our rehearsals begin at 11 o’clock in the morning including Wadaiko, which is a Japanese drum dance. We practice for about an hour and thirty minutes, then we have a brief meeting before the show. Rehearsals can be tough, but whatever we go over, ..it’s amazing and we have fun and I think it’s very good. Still, I think that there is a part where not a lot of the content catches on with the audience. Even after repeated viewings, I would like to think that each show was better than the one before it. But on the name alone, people were intrigued and when it arrived, it was beyond the imagination because I wanted it to be a thoughtful experience. Always keep going forward, it’s what we want out of this show. I want to make sure there’s more to it than just a name.</desc></programme>

It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials. The eco packaging company Avani is one firm offering plastic-free alternatives, including a bag made from cassava, a cheap and common root vegetable. The material is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea. Peter Avram, managing director of Avani Middle East, said: “Until a c</desc></programme>

Where else can you find people bragging about working unpaid overtime and writing appreciation posts to the companies that just laid them off? It’s a really weird website… But is it hurting your career? LinkedIn is a strange place where people talk at length about how great they are at their job to look enticing to potential future employers. In 2006 when the company was founded it was a strange concept, but it has worked for LinkedIn which is now the ninth largest social media platform in the world. It had more monthly users than twitter before both sites were acquired. Elon Musk and a team of investors purchased twitter for forty four BILLION dollars in October twenty-twenty-two, a record sum for a social media company being taken private. Musk’s controversial purchase beat LinkedIn’s record from 2016 when it was taken private by Microsoft from twenty-six point two billion dollars. Musk is often criticized for overpaying for twitter when LinkedIn is the comparison. At the time of acquisition LinkedIn had slightly more monthly users than Twitter but it also had something that the blue bird just couldn’t match. Every time you log into LinkedIn you are giving Microsoft something unmatched by every other social network in existence, value. If you are using a service for free YOU are the product and LinkedIn users are the most valuable product of them all. LinkedIn generated revenues of thirteen point eight billion dollars in 2022 which is two and a half times higher than twitters highest year of revenue ever. We don’t have public figures on it now since it is a private company but most analyst expect that twitters revenues are down since Musk’s acquisition. The average LinkedIn user is worth seventy six times more than the average reddit user, thirty five times more than the average Pinterest user, four times as much as the average YouTube viewer and three times as much as the average Facebook user.

Here is how you can do the same thing The two hundred and seventy-nine million dollar award more than doubled the one hundred and fourteen million dollar reward that the SEC issued in October of 2020. In total their whistle blower rewards program has paid out over a billion dollars since it was established in 2010. The best part is because the Dodd-Frank Act protects the confidentiality of whistle-blowers and informants no additional information is known about the people who have received these life changing payouts. The securities and exchange commission actually recognises in their press releases that these payouts have added up to a lot of money that could have been given back to the victims of financial crime. But there is three good reasons that [despite the spiralling costs] the SEC has kept the program and actually doubled down on promoting it with payout leader boards and flashy announcements every time a big payout is made. You get the feeling that if it wasnt for the informant privacy laws they would present a novelty size check in front of the press like the whistle-blowers just won the Powerball. But they cant so if you decide that you like the idea of a completely anonymous multi-million-dollar payday I will also tell you the steps that you need to take to become a successful snitch. The first reason that the SEC has set up this program is that its very hard to collect evidence on the white-collar crime they go after. Insider trading hurts regular investors but if the insiders are careful about their communications channels, they can make it almost impossible to collect evidence even with full time surveillance. The SEC admits that a significant amount of clearly illegal activity goes undetected or unpunished. Independent investigations have estimated that only about 15 of financial crimes are ever detected and even fewer are enforced. Nobody know</desc></programme>

First documented in the 14th century, Saschiz is known for its medieval fortress and church constructed by Transylvanian Saxons, a German speaker. They settled in Transylvania when it was part of Hungary. The ruins of the 14th-century fortress sit atop &quot;&amp;&quot;a hill overlooking the village. The late 15th-century fortified church has Gothic details and an imposing clock tower. Along with five other villages with fortified churches, Saschiz was inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in 1999.</desc></programme>

Then we spoke with Jason Jiang, Chief Business Officer at CertiK, who outlined how real-time monitoring and smarter compliance tools are transforming security in blockchain—and why regulators are finally catching up. Lastly, Damu Winston from Amazon Web3 joined us to discuss the convergence of Web3, AI, and spatial computing—plus a surprise appearance from his personal AI agent Samir, who gave us a glimpse into the not-so-distant future.</desc></programme>

But Mayor De Pfeffle cannot seem to understand what happened to his purple custard freshly sent over by Nino. So Mewmew offers to help while taking eggs over to Tiggy’s. But the carton turns out to only have one egg, and Tiggy needs to make eight more jars of purple custard. The answer seems to lie in Deedee’s magic spell that makes one purple custard jar never run out of purple custard for the entire day. And it works like a charm, non-stop purple custard. The Mayor gets a half eaten jar of purple custard and keeps it safe for after, only to have it finished by the Doobydoos. As the Mayor turns up at Tiggy’s once more for more purple custard, he rushes off with the jar that the spell has been cast on. A happy Mayor gets Mewmew to stay guard of the jar while he is out, and Mewmew catches the Doobydoos red handed trying to eat the custard. But the jar tips over in the confusion and unknown to Mewmew the loyal custard guard, the bottle keeps on flowing till it reaches the ground floor. Deedee is called in urgency and only Nino can fly up the building and put the jar right up again. Having done that they call all the townsfolk to come to town hall to eat up as much purple custard as they can. All join in and have a hearty treat, so much so that they cannot have a bite more. Finally Mayor De Pfeffle arrives and is happy to share his purple custard with everyone, but much to his surprise no one wants any. Wonder why?</desc></programme>

But as Deedee doesn’t have any spell to make Tommy’s shyness go away she improvises without magic by making Tommy believe that she has cast a spell on Tommy’s hat. Tommy agrees to attend the party in the guise that the hat he is wearing is now a chatter hat that will help him talk to others at the party. Nino is confused as he’s happy on one side that magic wasn’t used but sad that Tommy thinks magic is used. Tommy Prickles fits right in at the party and has fun playing with the Doobydoos and talks so freely and happily with everyone. Just then a huge gust of wind ruffles everything including Tommy’s hat. Poor sad Tommy feels so shy and helpless that he wants to go back home. But Deedee implores him to stay by trying to make him hopeful that Nino would return soon with Tommy’s hat.

Tommy reasons with Deedee that all of Abra-Dabra will think of him as silly, but Deedee tells him that if he couldn’t believe her, then to at least believe those who love having him along. Tommy looks up to see all his friends walking up to him doing the Wiggly Worm dance. Tommy takes a brave step and listens to his friends wanting have him back.

Sundar, himself too pouring from his pores, ignores his discomfort and sets about switching the blast of breeze (though its a rickety and extremely temperamental old fan) to keep the customers cool. But Basha wants his bit of breeze and is intent to steal the wind from Sundars sails! A tug-of-war for the fan ensues... Basha plays havoc sticking vadas under the fan for wheels and wheeling it off or by hoisting it up with a tricky fishing line. Sundar tries to keep the customers happy by using palm-leaf fans and fanning with all limbs possible...but the customers are too many. And Basha aggravates matters by using the fans breeze to spray paint Sundars body with fruit juice! Sundar chases Basha who smartly propels himself about with the fan, and even blows pillow fluff at Sundar to deter him from the chase. But the last proves to be a bad idea as the fluff sticks in the fan blades, damages it and the rusty things blows up! Scene cuts to show Sundar running behind Basha..but when camera pulls back we see that the two are on a kind of crude treadmill that powers a giant coconut frond wind-mill that lulls breeze at the tea-shop.

Boris got one too, but he doesn’t want his to get dirty at all. So he decides not to use it at all even though he misses all the fun Sandy is having. Mewmew and Sandy even have a race across town. Boris even declines a chance to race, but is entirely sceptical about it as he doesn’t even want a splash of mud to fall on it. He is even more worried when he sees Sandy’s car not working. Deedee tries to help by magically trying to create a bubble guard around Boris’s car, but the spell falls on Sandy’s car instead. Now no one can even touch the car, let alone repair it. Boris vouches to allow Sandy use his car as he acknowledges that it was his undoing that led to the creation of the bubble in the first place. Sandy is overjoyed and promises to be extra careful. So careful that Mewmew can even beat her by running on his ears. Deedee tells Boris to prove to Sandy that she can use the car faster, so Boris races with Mewmew and accidentally splashes mud over his face, but then is happy he does and enjoys the fun. He races so fast that he pops the bubble guard over Sandy’s car by crashing into it. Charlie sets down to fix the cars and the twins are driving them in a jiffy, giggling all the way.</desc></programme>

So she conjures a invisi-ball game. But the spell bounces off the ball and makes Nino invisible instead. Deedee is sad her spell went cuckoo on Nino, but Nino can’t stand her magic any more, so she checks out a remedy in her magic book and finds that the spell would cancel itself with three chimes of the town hall bell. Deedee decides to get Nino to the spot at the earliest. Nino scares the Doobydoos in his new ‘form’, but soon gets them to play along as he removes his helmet and is completely invisible now. Nino loves the fact that he is invisible and plays tricks on sleepy Charlie. Deedee sees the Doobydoos playing with the helmet and think they are throwing Nino about. But when she realizes that Nino isn’t in it, she is even more worried as the spell can become permanent if it isn’t cancelled soon. Nino has lots of fun playing pranks on Tiggy, Deedee, Charlie and Mewmew. Nino soon realizes that his pranks have gone out of hand that Mayor De Pfeffle announces over the loudspeaker to get Nino to come to them. Nino appears and is stubborn to stay invisible, so Deedee catches Nino with her hat and gets him in place to take full effect of the town hall chimes. Having regained his visibility, Nino agrees that a little magic is fun.</desc></programme>

With extreme care and caution (and reverence), he sets about making tea, but then there is a sudden visit by the politician who demands that Chai Raja sit with him to discuss about tea provision for the upcoming elections. Chai Raja cant refuse and Sundar has to take on the task of tea making while Chai Raja sits with the politician. Sundar, knowing Chai Rajas affections for the special kettle handles it with kid gloves but he doesnt anticipate Basha poking his tail in and thats when mayhem ensues. As Chai Raja glares intermittently from afar, Sundar desperately tries to keep the pot boiling without melting it up altogether. He is however distracted by the customers who dont much seem to like the taste of tea being served that day. Basha takes advantage of Sundars distraction and flicks the kettle. Sundar desperately tries to get it back. He lunges and manages to yank Basha by his tail, but this only sends the ancient kettle flying. Later we see Chai Raja tearfully hang up a new wind-chime (made of pieces of his antique kettle) and then glare at Sundar who has been assigned a tower of dishes to wash. Basha sniggers in the distance, blowing into the spout of the kettle, whistling the chai chaitune!</desc></programme>

Oops! Quickly putting Sundar in charge, Chai Raja hops on his rusty cycle and heads off for fresh stock. Meanwhile, Sundar sees the customers line up and for the sake of Chai Raja wants to somehow keep them happy. Sundar sees Basha snacking on his private banana reserve and sprinting over strikes a deal with Basha- give me your bananas for now, and I will let you snack. Basha, after a moments thought agrees and the deal is struck. As Basha in an odd moment of generosity, entertains the customers, Sundar frantically hashes up fritters- but when Basha shows up for his share, Sundarsidelines him and serves the customers. When this happens more than twice, Basha loses his nice-guy face and decides to set things straight. The customers find their plates vanishing and their teas arriving in curious ways. Sundar tries to iron things out, but Basha is in a frenzy. Soon when Chai Raja arrives triumphantly hoisting fresh bananas, he is literally stampeded by the fleeing customers. Sundar stands sheepish as not far away Basha chuckles holding a pile of banana fritters. He bites into one and chews...but then in disgust spits it out; after all Sundar cant cook like Chai Raja. Shrugging, Basha digs out his special reserve banana and chews on it philosophically.</desc></programme>

Chai Raja looks up and is not one jot happy to see his bossy estranged uncle Commando Kappa. Commando Kappa is a bossy man who wants to take over the hotel from Chai Raja and is zany enough to try any underhanded trick . Sundar senses this animosity and wants Kappa out of the shop but 6 and a half foot , Arnold like built Commando Kappa is a tough man to cross. Because he is no great cook, Kappa uses his army tactics to sabotage and tries messing up Chai Rajas ingredients- he switches the ingredients for the tea, Chai Raja knives suddenly go missing etc- Chai Raja however is quick at adapting and when knives go missing he merely uses his moustache to chop the bananas! Sunder too does his best to foil Kappa. and save Chai Raja- like when Kappa accidentally spills oil intending to slip up Chai Raja, Sundar rather himself skid in and break his own bones just so Chai Raja doesnt step into the oil or guzzle up all the chilli-spiced tea (thanks to Kappa dropping chilli powder into the brew on the sly) before Chai Raja serves it to customers and loses his reputation. However the curious Basha keeps poking his naughty nose in and its difficult for Sundar to keep up with Kappas ploys. Kappa tries to finally seize up the flexible Chai Raja, by offering a tampered herbal oil to limber him up (the oil actually stiffens whatever it is poured on- can demonstrate the effect when Kappa does a test on a small sapling on the sill). But just then Sundar and Basha tumble in as part of their chase and the oil flies landing on Kappa gets all seized up and stiff. The cricked Kappa gives up and is shown the door and Basha gives him a 21- banana peel sendoff. But Sundar has no time to rejoice for Basha is again sneaking up to the fries and must be stopped.</desc></programme>

Chai Raja sloshes his special night brew and some spills onto the plant. The plant shudders unnoticed by anyone, the brew boosting its growth so quickly...that by morning when Sundar wakes up he shrieks to find a massive venus fly trap in place of the small fragile sapling he had left the night before.

And when the spell is cast, the recipe book opens up exactly at the recipe of a pie made of Tika Pila flowers. The problem is that only the Doobydoos can pick the Tika Pila flowers as it grows in the most prickly cacti in Abra-Dabra! But no matter how much Deedee and Nino coax Tiggy to work on another recipe; Tiggy is totally fixated on the Tika Pila flower pie. Though the Doobydoos love eating the flowers, they are too scared of the loud and angry Tika Pila monster that guards them and rush off in a hurry. They finally hit a bargain with Tiggy in exchange for a hundred custard sandwiches. Only with much reassuring and coaxing they pick every Tika Pila flower around. Mayor De Pfeffel is already at Tiggy’s and really hungry. But one Doobydoo is too ambitious and stays back to pick the last Tika Pila flower, but that awakes the Tika Pila monster and he shouts the biggest shout ever, scaring Tiggy and making the pie fly up high and splatter down on his face! The inevitable terrible has happened and there is nothing to give the Mayor. Just then when things couldn’t get any worse Mayor De Pfeffel lunges inside and is happy to see a whole plate of his favourite custard sandwiches.</desc></programme>

Deedee is sad her spell went cuckoo on Nino, but Nino can’t stand her magic any more, so she checks out a remedy in her magic book and finds that the spell would cancel itself with three chimes of the town hall bell. Deedee decides to get Nino to the spot at the earliest. Nino scares the Doobydoos in his new ‘form’, but soon gets them to play along as he removes his helmet and is completely invisible now. Nino loves the fact that he is invisible and plays tricks on sleepy Charlie. Deedee sees the Doobydoos playing with the helmet and think they are throwing Nino about. But when she realizes that Nino isn’t in it, she is even more worried as the spell can become permanent if it isn’t cancelled soon. Nino has lots of fun playing pranks on Tiggy, Deedee, Charlie and Mewmew. Nino soon realizes that his pranks have gone out of hand that Mayor De Pfeffle announces over the loudspeaker to get Nino to come to them. Nino appears and is stubborn to stay invisible, so Deedee catches Nino with her hat and gets him in place to take full effect of the town hall chimes. Having regained his visibility, Nino agrees that a little magic is fun.</desc></programme>

After getting a hint from Charlie on how much he loves chess, boris and sandy plan the birthday party around a ‘knights and castles’ theme. The twins get Deedee to bring balloons, a castle cake with turrets from Tiggy and a jousting dance from Mewmew. Boris and Sandy set out to decorate Uncle Charlie’s house, just in time for their friends coming in with all the goodies for the party. They even invent a balloon jousting game between Deedee and Mewmew that makes Mewmew crash into Tiggy’s cake and thereby wreck all the arrangements much to the dismay of the twins. This calls for Deedee’s magic where all the party ingredients are put into a large purple cauldron and it makes a gigantic bouncing castle in the chequerboard garden. And the snoring sounds lead them to find Uncle Charlie napping right inside it. They bounce around Uncle Charlie as much as they can and then wind down for a long snooze.

And when the spell is cast, the recipe book opens up exactly at the recipe of a pie made of Tika Pila flowers. The problem is that only the Doobydoos can pick the Tika Pila flowers as it grows in the most prickly cacti in Abra-Dabra! But no matter how much Deedee and Nino coax Tiggy to work on another recipe; Tiggy is totally fixated on the Tika Pila flower pie. Though the Doobydoos love eating the flowers, they are too scared of the loud and angry Tika Pila monster that guards them and rush off in a hurry. They finally hit a bargain with Tiggy in exchange for a hundred custard sandwiches. Only with much reassuring and coaxing they pick every Tika Pila flower around. Mayor De Pfeffel is already at Tiggy’s and really hungry. But one Doobydoo is too ambitious and stays back to pick the last Tika Pila flower, but that awakes the Tika Pila monster and he shouts the biggest shout ever, scaring Tiggy and making the pie fly up high and splatter down on his face! The inevitable terrible has happened and there is nothing to give the Mayor. Just then when things couldn’t get any worse Mayor De Pfeffel lunges inside and is happy to see a whole plate of his favourite custard sandwiches.</desc></programme>

But Mewmew is impatient to wait till next year which calls for Deedee’s magic. Deedee puts a spell of ‘grow faster’ on the beans making them sprout soon enough. The next morning Mayor De Pfeffle polishes the Gardening Star to a shining bright sparkle, then sets off to inspect. Deedee and Nino find Mewmew trapped in her house strangled tight by huge beanstalks. The only way to pry her free would be to pluck all the beans off the stalks thanks to Tiggy’s suggestion on what to do. But though Mewmew didn’t have much of a garden, hew friends were able to put up a fabulous rock garden that got Mewmew a special recognition star from Mayor De Pfeffle. Just then Tiggy comes along with his special bean soup, much to the delight of everyone, except Mewmew who is a bit overloaded with seeing so many beans that day.</desc></programme>

But thinking of the possibility of the idea, Charlie tries a hand at throwing a newspaper onto Tiggy’s lawn, but ends up flying in through the window. On hearing a scream, Charlie rushes in apologising for hitting Tiggy, but it turned out that Tiggy was moaning for what he read in the newspaper. It was about a contest of the Chef Challenge Award featuring whether Tiggy’s rival, Chef Alfonse could win it. Tiggy always wanted to win the challenge but never knew what original recipe to make. Tiggy gets jealous as he reads Chef Alfonse’s fish-a-la mode recipe that he promises to create the dish himself and if turns out to be really good as the newspaper says it is, he will admit how good his rival really is. So Tiggy waits a long while at the lake to catch a fresh fish as the recipe calls for it. Soon all his friends come over to help him fish, each with their very own fish lines. Seems a little magical assistance can help this time. But the lake is now occupied by one big playful dragon fish. The dragon fish turns out to be really hungry, so Tiggy sets out to make the biggest beetroot and berry snack ever. The dragonfish gulps it all down happily, but Deedee is sad she couldn’t really help Tiggy with the recipe. Tiggy on the other hand is quite ecstatic that he was able to whip up the most original dish ever. So over pancakes the next day Tiggy discovers that he has been awarded the annual Chef Challenge Award for the most original beetroot and berry recipe based on the photo and information Deedee gave to the judges. Tiggy is delighted to see an appreciative comment by Chef Alfonse that Tiggy’s surprise-a-la dragonfish being totally top-notch.</desc></programme>

Sehmat has been in love with her husband Joginder since they were married as children, and she is excited to finally be reunited with him. However, on the day of their Muklawa, Joginder, who is an army man, is called away to fight in a war. The film then follows the emotional journey of Sehmat and Joginder as they navigate the difficulties of their separation and the choices they must make in the face of war. Joginder is torn between his love for Sehmat and his duty to his country, ultimately choosing to put his country first. This decision leaves Sehmat feeling both sad and proud, as she realizes the sacrifice that Joginder has made for his country.
